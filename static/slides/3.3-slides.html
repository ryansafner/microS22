&gt; "III. A sufficiently robust and gradually rising carbon tax will replace the need for various carbon regulations that are less efficient. Substituting a price signal for cumbersome regulations will promote economic growth and provide the regulatory certainty companies need for long-term investment in clean-energy alternatives."

# Externalities Adjudicated at Law

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Most externalities in U.S. mediated through common law legal system

- Courts assess how much harm was caused

- Individuals causing harm to others must pay:
  - **compensatory damages** (to redress harms)
  - **punitive damages** (to deter future externalities)
    
- Externalities persist if property rights are *not* clear or are *not* enforced

- .hi[Externalities] outside the market system of prices are a problem

- Exchange is really about property rights over goods and services, (not just the goods themselves)

- Origin of the problem is: .hi-purple[property rights are not clear (undefined or unenforced)]!
  - Who has right/responsibility over activity creating the external harm?

- .hi[Coase Theorem]: if transactions costs are low, clearly defined property rights allow parties to bargain to the efficient social outcome *regardless* of who has the property right
