# Producer Behavior

.pull-left[

- How do **producers** decide:
  - which products to produce
  - in what quantity
  - using which inputs
  - and sold at what price?

- Answers to these questions are building blocks for .hi-red[supply curves]

# The Basics of Production

.pull-left[

- Nearly all goods must be **produced** before we can exchange & consume them

- .hi[Consumption] is the **destruction** of value to gain utility
    - Consumption is the ultimate goal of all economic activity

# The Basics of Production

.pull-left[

- .hi[Production] is the **creation** of value, by transforming *lower*-valued goods (resources, inputs, etc) into *higher*-valued goods (outputs, consumer products, etc)
]

# It's Demand all the Way Down!

.pull-left[

- .hi-red[Supply] is actually .hi-blue[Demand] in disguise!

- The .hi[(opportunity) cost] producers must pay to purchase (scarce) inputs to produce products comes from the fact that **other people** .hi-blue[demand] those same inputs to consume or produce **other things** for other purposes!
  - You are not paying the price just to buy them, but also to **pull them out of other valuable lines of production** in the economy!
