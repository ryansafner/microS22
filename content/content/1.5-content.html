<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>Solving a one-time constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the <em>dynamics</em> of change are far more interesting and useful: how do people optimally <em>respond</em> to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income.</p>
<p>An individual’s <strong>demand function</strong> (often just called <strong>“demand”</strong>) for a particular good describes how that person optimally responds to changes in market conditions. While in truth, many things factor into one’s demand for a good, we are simplifying the model to relate a person’s quantity demanded of a good to three things: the price of that good (“own” price), the price of <em>other</em> goods, and the person’s income. When we look only at the relationship between quantity demanded and the good’s price (holding constant the other two things — other prices, and income), this is the familiar <strong>demand curve</strong> you see on supply and demand graphs from principles.</p>
<p>Today, we look only at how changes in <em>income</em> or changes in the prices of <em>other</em> goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.</p>
<p>In doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an <em>elasticity.</em> You’ve seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the “midpoint formula.” There’s a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.</p>

<h2><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher"></i> Slides</h2>
<p>Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.</p>
<p>The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (<em>not everything</em> is in the slides)!</p>
