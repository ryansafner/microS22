<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>We wrap up Unit 2 on today by discussing <strong>external economies</strong>, which are cost externalities within an entire industry, but we will be skipping this for time. I put my slides here if you want to know more. The idea is firms entering/exiting a profitable/unprofitable industry over the long run certainly shift the industry supply curve and change the market equilibrium. But in a lot of industries as more firms enter and produce and compete with one another, that might raise costs for <em>all firms</em> (increasing cost industry/external diseconomies) or lower costs for <em>all firms</em> (decreasing cost industry/external economies). These effects may create either an upward sloping, flat, or downward sloping industry supply curve over the long run.</p>
<p>We also end by looking at market supply functions, allowing us to fully transition into Unit III with Supply &amp; Demand.</p>
<p>After a short lecture on 2.7 today, we will have a <strong>review session</strong> for <a href="/assignments/02-exam"><strong>Exam 2</strong></a>, which will on Monday April 4.</p>

<p>Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.</p>
<p>The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (<em>not everything</em> is in the slides)!</p>
