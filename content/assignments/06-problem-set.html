<p>Show all work for calculations. You may lose points, even if correct, for missing work. Be sure to label graphs fully, if appropriate.</p>
<div id="question-6" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 6</h2>
<p>Consider the following <em>Entry game</em> in normal form. Suppose there are two firms, each of whom can choose to Enter a market, or Stay Out. If both firms enter, they split the market, each earning $50. If both stay out, each firm earns $0. If one enters and the other stays out, the entrant can act as a monopolist and earns $100, with the other firm earning $0.</p>
<p><img src="https://microf21.classes.ryansafner.com/images/entrygame1.png" /></p>
<p>What is the Nash Equilibrium of this game?</p>
</div>
<div id="question-7" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 7</h2>
<p>Suppose you are a restaurant in a <strong>monopolistically competitive</strong> industry. Your firm has a constant marginal and average cost at $4 per unit.</p>

<div id="part-a" class="section level3">

</div>
<div id="part-b" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>Calculate the (i) consumer surplus, (ii) profit, and (iii) deadweight loss at this price and quantity. Show these on the graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c" class="section level3">
<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>Now suppose this firm has market power from a barrier to entry, and can operate like a monopolist. What price and quantity does it set?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-d" class="section level3">
<h3>Part D</h3>
<p>Calculate the (i) consumer surplus, (ii) profit, and (iii) deadweight loss at this price and quantity. Show these on the graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-e" class="section level3">
<h3>Part E</h3>
<p>Now suppose that the firm had earned this market power via rent-seeking. From its lobbying efforts, it had convinced the local government to require all new restaurants to get a special license, making it harder for new entrants to compete in the market. What was the most that this firm was willing to spend on lobbying in order to get the license requirement?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-f" class="section level3">
<h3>Part F</h3>
<p>If there are 10 identical (in terms of costs and size, if not food or brand) restaurants in the industry, and all engage in maximal rent-seeking to obtain the license, what is the true total cost of market power in this market to society?</p>
