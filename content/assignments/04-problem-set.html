<p>Please answer the following questions briefly (1-3 sentences). Use examples as necessary. Be sure to label graphs fully, if appropriate.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>What is the difference between accounting profit and economic profit? Is it possible for a firm to be profitable in an accounting sense but not an economic sense? Is it possible for a firm to be profitable in an economic sense but not an accounting sense?</p>
</div>
<div id="question-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>In a competitive industry, with <em>identical</em> firms (e.g. all firms have the same costs, there are no economic rents), why are profits normal (zero) in the long run?</p>
</div>
<div id="question-3" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>In a competitive industry, even among firms with <em>significant cost differences</em> (e.g. there are economic rents), why do profits tend to return to normal (0) in the long run?</p>

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<p>Frame de Art is an art framing shop in a small town. Frame de Art has one storefront (with a rent of <span>$</span>500/week), and can hire workers for <span>$</span>300/week per worker. The table below shows how output of framed art (in 100s/week) varies with the number of workers.</p>

<h2>Question 5</h2>
<p>Mike’s Bikes produces racing bicycles. Consider the following graph, which illustrates the short run average total cost curves corresponding to three possible plant sizes Mike could produce with: a small plant, a medium plant, and a large plant.</p>

<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>Draw the <em>long run average cost curve</em> on the graph provided (or sketch one yourself).</p>

<div id="part-d" class="section level3">
<h3>Part D</h3>
<p>Suppose Mike’s long run total cost function can be roughly expressed as:<br />
<span class="math display">\[LRC(q)=\frac{1}{64}q^3-6.25q^2+725q\]</span>
with a long run marginal cost function of</p>
