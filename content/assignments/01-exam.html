<h1>Exam Information</h1>
<p><strong>You may not have anything with you</strong> for the exam (no notes, etc) <strong>except a calculator.</strong> I write questions such that you can get a perfect score <em>without</em> a calculator, and answers should typically be simple whole numbers. However, I understand that if nothing else, calculators are moral support and you can use them. I will provide simple calculators if you need to borrow one, as well as extra paper.</p>
<p>I write the exam so that most students can complete it in less than the required time, but you will have the whole class period, plus a few minutes between classes. Questions draw from concepts in the slides and whatever we discuss in class, <strong>no other outside knowledge is needed.</strong></p>
<p>You may need to draw graphs — I will grade you based on labeling important points, not on drawing ability or perfect accuracy.</p>
<p><strong>You must show your work for all problems.</strong> On all exam questions, <strong>I give points for partial credit.</strong> The more of your thought process you show (if you are unsure), the more points I am able to give. <strong>Both correct answers with no work shown, or blank answers will not receive full points.</strong></p>
<p>Please plan to come in and leave a seat between you and your neighbor.</p>
<p>If you have any approved testing accommodations, or know in advance you must be absent, please confirm with me ASAP and we will make arrangements.</p>

<h1>Concepts Study Guide</h1>

<li><a href="/examprep/exam_1_study_guide.pdf"><i class="fas fa-file-pdf"></i> Download PDF</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we skipped some excess content about preferences this semester, so some things on the study guide (like assumptions about preferences, assumptions about indifference curves, indifference curves for non-goods – the graph on page 5, steepness –graph on page 7–but know complements &amp; substitutes!), you can safely ignore.</p>

<h1>“Practice” Exam</h1>

</ul>
<p>Above, you have a previous semester’s actual exam. Use it to get a sense of what questions are asked, the format, and how many. <strong>The exact number and type of questions on our exam may be different.</strong> For example, this semester we skipped some things about preferences, so you would not be responsible for questions asking about them. In this old exam, that means questions 5 and 9. Though, you should still be able to deduce the answers from your existing knowledge!</p>
<p>Questions draw from topics in Unit 1 and just because topics or questions were not in the practice exam does NOT mean they may not show up on your exam.**<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Aside from minor extensions, no mathematical problem on any exam should be something you have not seen in some form before.</p>
<p>Look at the practice exam <em>before</em> our Review day. I will post the answer key during the weekend. I am happy to discuss other individual answers and strategies during Office Hours.</p>

<div id="my-advice" class="section level1">
<h1>My Advice</h1>
<p>Make sure you do all of the homework problems and learn from the answer keys to the homeworks, as well as the in-class practice problems. All of the math problems are largely in the same style as the in-class &amp; homework questions. While some of the questions should be novel applications, conceptual questions on homeworks will get you in the right headspace to think about answering a question on an exam.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The number one cause of problems for students is overthinking the question. <strong>I am almost never trying to trick you!</strong> I am usually looking for a straightforward answer that can be explained in a simple sentence.</p>
<p>I also suggest <em>not</em> trying to memorize relationships (i.e. whether cross-price elasticity of demand is positive or negative for complements; price and revenue move together when demand is inelastic, etc.)! You have an equal chance of remembering it correctly or incorrectly. I would rather recommend you use your intuition and think through a real life example that makes sense, which will then match the math.</p>
<div id="things-you-should-probably-memorize" class="section level2">
<h2>Things you <em>should</em> probably memorize</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>the optimum consumption bundle is when the slopes (of indifference curve and budget constraint) are equal; marginal benefit = marginal cost; consumer’s &amp; market’s exchange rate are equal</em> (they all say the same thing, choose whatever resonates with you)
<span class="math display">\[\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}=\frac{p_x}{p_y}\]</span></li>
<li><em>elasticity means “responsiveness” between variables</em></li>
<li>what marginal rate of substitution, slopes of indifference curves &amp; budget constraints, marginal utility, and various elasticities <em>mean, in English</em></li>
</ul>
