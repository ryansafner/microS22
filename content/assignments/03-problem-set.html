</div>
<div id="part-c-2" class="section level3">

<div id="question-8" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 8</h2>
<p>Mad Max’s Road Warriors fix potholes in interstate highways. Max’s road crews fill potholes using workers and shovels, always in 1 to 1 combinations. Using 1 worker with 1 shovel can fill 10 potholes in a day. A worker with 2 shovels can still only fill 10 potholes, as can 2 workers with 1 shovel.</p>
<div id="part-a-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Part A</h3>
<p>What is the relationship between workers and shovels as inputs?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-b-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>Draw three production isoquants: one corresponding to filling 10 potholes, one for 20 potholes, and one for 30 potholes.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>Mad Max receives a state contract to fill in 30 potholes. If the price of shovels is $10, and wages are $5, what is the lowest cost Mad Max can fulfill the contract at? Plot this isocost line on the graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-d-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Part D</h3>
<p>Add two more isocost lines to the graph, one for a total cost of $15 and one for $30. Hint: you’ll need to find the equations, and nicely, the slope doesn’t change.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-e-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Part E</h3>
<p>If the cost of buying a shovel rises from $10 to $20, what will happen to the rate at which Max Max combines workers and shovels to fill the potholes? Why?</p>

<h2>Question 9</h2>
<p>Your firm builds aircraft engines using both labor (L) and power tools (K). The production function for aircraft engines is <span class="math inline">\(q=10 L^{0.5}K^{0.5}\)</span></p>
<div id="part-a-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Part A</h3>
<p>Can you completely mechanize the production of aircraft engines (i.e. produce using all capital, no labor)?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-b-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>Suppose you currently have 100 power tools. In the short run, you cannot buy or sell power tools. Derive your short run production function.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c-4" class="section level3">

<div id="question-10" class="section level2">
<h2>Question 10</h2>
<p>Dunder Mifflin paper company produces reams of paper each week according to the production function:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}q &amp;=10 l^{0.5} k^{0.5}\\
MP_l&amp; = 5l^{-0.5}k^{0.5}\\
MP_k&amp; = 5l^{0.5}k^{-0.5}\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>They have determined that they need to ship 1,000 reams of paper this week to Scranton, PA. Using capital costs $20, whereas labor costs $10.</p>
<div id="part-a-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Part A</h3>
<p>What is the cost-minimizing combination of labor and capital that will yield 1,000 reams of paper? Round each to the nearest whole number.</p>
</div>
<div id="part-b-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Part B</h3>
<p>What is the total cost of using this combination of inputs?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-c-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Part C</h3>
<p>Now suppose that they need to double their output this week, and need to produce 2,000 reams of paper. How does their optimal combination of inputs change?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="part-d-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Part D</h3>
<p>What is the total cost of this new level of output?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-e-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Part E</h3>
<p>Suppose management at Dunder Mifflin develops a new program that magically makes everyone at the firm more productive, such that the firm’s new production function becomes:
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}q &amp;=20 l^{0.5} k^{0.5}\\
MP_l&amp; = 10l^{-0.5}k^{0.5}\\
MP_k&amp; = 10l^{0.5}k^{-0.5}\\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>Still needing to supply 2,000 reams of paper this week at the same input prices, what is their new optimal combination of labor and capital?</p>
</div>
<div id="part-f-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Part F</h3>
<p>How much does this combination cost? What does this show you about technological improvement (or “total factor productivity”)?</p>
