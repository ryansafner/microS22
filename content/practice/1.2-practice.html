<p>You can get music via downloads (<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>) or concert tickets (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>). You have <span>$</span>60 to spend each week, and the price of a download is <span>$</span>3 and the price of a concert ticket is <span>$</span>10. Put <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> on the horizontal axis and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> on the vertical axis.</p>
