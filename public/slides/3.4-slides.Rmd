  - Markets reach equilibrium
  - Economic profits are zero in the long run in competitive markets

- Both are **fictional**

- .hi[Futures markets]: where people buy/sell claims on *future* goods at specified prices
  - e.g. “10 barrels of oil at $30/barrel, delivered on November 2021”

# Knowledge, “Speculation,” and Prices

.pull-left[

- .hi[Prediction markets]: where people buy/sell claims on *verifiable* future outcomes at specified prices
  - Hope to profit on information you believe to be true
  - Provides incentives for people to reveal private information for public benefit

- If you want to know what somebody truly believes, leverage the power of prices and .hi-purple[make a bet]
  - Forces them to “put their money where their mouth is” and make a costly tradoff: false beliefs vs. losing money

# Uncertainty, Tacit Information, and Profit I

- **Economic theory**: in a perfectly competitive market, in the long run, economic profit $\rightarrow$ to zero

- **Real world**: there *are* often economic profits

- Our blackboard models assume perfect information

- In reality we have to deal with .hi-purple[uncertainty]

- .hi-purple[In a world of certainty, there would be no profit]
  - The model world of perfect competition is a fictional world of certainty

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Firms don’t actually *maximize* profits, just a convenient assumption
  - In a world of uncertainty (unlike mere risk), there’s no way to *maximize* anything!

- Real world is not merely a constrained maximization problem!

- Better to think in **evolutionary** terms
  - Firms that *best* adapt to market circumstances will earn profit and merely *survive*
  - Whether by skill and talent or just dumb luck!

- Profits are an indication that **value is being created for society**

- People often confuse the .hi[economic problem] with a .hi-purple[technological problem]

- .hi-purple[Technological problem]: how to allocate scarce resources to accomplish a particular goal
    - e.g. buy the right combination of goods to maximize utility
    - e.g. buy the right combination of inputs and produce output to maximize profits 
    - given stable prices, preferences, and technologies, **a computer can solve this problem**
