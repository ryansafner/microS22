# Price Discrimination

- The most obvious way to capture more surplus is to raise prices
  - But **Law of Demand** $\implies$ this would turn many customers away!

- Also, we saw that if a firm wants to sell more units, it has to lower the price on all units!

# Pricing and Markup

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- How much should each segment be charged?

- Firm treats each segment as a *different* market
  1. Find q*: $MR(q)=MC(q)$ 
  2. Raise p* to maximum WTP (Demand)

- Lerner index implies optimal markup for each segment, again:
$$\underbrace{\frac{p-MC(q)}{p}}_{\text{Markup % of Price}}=-\frac{1}{\epsilon}$$

# 3<sup>rd</sup>-Degree Price Discrimination: Numerical Example

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
.green[**Example**]: Suppose you run a bar in downtown Frederick, and estimate the nightly demands for beer from undergraduates $(U)$ and graduates $(G)$ to be:

$$\begin{align*}
q_U&=18-4p_U\\
q_G&=12-p_G\\
\end{align*}$$

Assume the only cost of producing a beer is a constant marginal (and average) cost of $2.

]

1. If your bar had to charge a uniform price for beer, how much profit would the bar earn?

2. If you could price discriminate, how much profit would the bar earn?

# Is Price Discrimination Good or Bad? I

.pull-left[

- A price-discriminating monopolist transfers MORE surplus from consumers to producers

- But encourages monopolist to produce more than the pure monopoly level and reduce deadweight loss!

# Is Price Discrimination Good or Bad? II

.pull-left[

- Price-discrimination creates incentives for innovation and risk-taking

# Is Price Discrimination Good or Bad? III

.pull-left[

- As with markups in general, price discrimination has everything to do with .hi[price elasticity of demand]

- If you are paying too much and losing consumer surplus, the real “problem” is that .hi-purple[your demand is not very elastic]
  - fewer options, a particular brand, or a necessity, limited time, etc

- If you want to pay less, .hi-purple[buy generic] (more elastic)

# How to Be a Savvy Consumer

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Realize that any “sales” and “discounts” are calculated to make *the store* more money

- You *can* also be better off as a consumer too

- Think about your .blue[consumer surplus]!

- If you were *already* planning to buy the product, a fall in price is **a good deal** for you
  - Your demand is less elastic

- If you *weren’t* going to buy the product before, and now you do, the sale was effective for the store, and you likely don’t get much surplus
  - Your demand is more elastic

# Price Discrimination vs. Price Differences

.pull-left[

- .hi[Price discrimination] is selling *identical* goods to people at different prices

- But not everytime people pay different prices means it is price discrimination

- Sometimes it is truly different goods that people are paying different prices for
  - If *costs* to firm are *different* for different versions (color, size, etc.), it is a *different* good, *not* price discrimination

# Price Discrimination vs. Price Differences

.pull-left[

- .hi-green[Example]: bottled sparkling water often higher price than Coca Cola

- Could be because sparkling water drinkers have less elastic demand than Coke drinkers

- Or could be that it is more expensive to package sparkling water (economies of scale with greater number of Coke drinkers)

# Price Discrimination vs. Price Differences

.pull-left[

- The best way to tell the difference is to see what happens if demand changes price elasticity (and costs do not change)
  - Price discrimination requires market power, firm with market power marks up price based on $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$
  - Competitive firm only sets $p=MC$, so change in elasticity has no effect on price

- See [today’s class notes](/content/4.3-content) for a graphical demonstration

- Firms often .hi[tie] multiple goods together, where you must buy both goods in order to consume the product

# Tying II
