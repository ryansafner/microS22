On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components \u0026ndash; an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.  My suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.   At least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on heuristics or memory to \u0026ldquo;fill in the blanks.\u0026rdquo; You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it\u0026rsquo;s discovered you haven\u0026rsquo;t done the reading. Do the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you \u0026ldquo;get inside my head\u0026rdquo; and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade. Work on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.^[Yes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!] As a wise woman once told me \u0026ldquo;whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.\u0026rdquo; Learn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that\u0026rsquo;s relevant in the real world.^[Yes, Google is your best friend.

Finally, depending on your OS, convert the files to a PDF:\n1. On a Windows PC\nOpen the folder where your photos are currently, in the File Explorer. Select all of the photos, and right click, and select Print. In the dialog box that pops up, select Microsoft Print to PDF in the Printer box, and then click Print. This will save it as a .pdf file in that folder. See more information.\n2. On a Mac\nAs I use a Mac, I will show you how Mac OS has a neat feature built into Finder, which allows converting multiple files into a single PDF file as a Quick Action. I have written two pages in a notebook and taken two separate pictures of them, and airdropped them onto my computer.\nHere is the  example PDF.\n3.

In its general form a function can be written as:\n\\[q = q(p)\\]\n “Quantity (\\(q\\)) is a function of price (\\(p\\))” This expresses that there is a relationship between \\(q\\) and \\(p\\), it doesn’t tell us the specific form of that relationship  \\(q\\) is the dependent or “endogenous” variable, its value is determined by \\(p\\) \\(p\\) is the independent or “exogenous” variable, its value is given and not dependent on other variables The specific form of this function might be:   \\[q = 100-6p\\]\n The numbers 100 and 6 are known as parameters, they are parts of the quantitative relationship between quantity and price (the variables) that do not change If we have values of \\(p\\), we can find the value of \\(q(p)\\):  When \\(p=10\\) \\[ \\begin{align*} q(p)\u0026amp;=100-6p\\\\ q(10)\u0026amp;=100-6(10)\\\\ q(10)\u0026amp;=100-60\\\\ q(10)\u0026amp;=40\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] When \\(p=5\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} q(p)\u0026amp;=100-6p\\\\ q(5)\u0026amp;=100-6(5)\\\\ q(5)\u0026amp;=100-30\\\\ q(5)\u0026amp;=70\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]   Multivariate functions have multiple independent variables, such as:\n\\[q=f(k,l)\\]\n “Output (\\(q\\)) is a function of both capital (\\(k\\)) and labor (\\(l\\))”\n In economics, we often restrict the domain and range of functions to positive real numbers, \\(\\mathbb{R}_+\\), since prices and quantities are never negative in the real world\n Domain: the set of \\(x\\)-values Range: the set of \\(y\\)-values determined by the function   Inverse Functions  Many functions have a useful inverse, where we switch the independent variable and dependent variable  For example, if we have the demand function: \\[q=100-6p\\] we may want find the inverse demand function, an equation where \\(p\\) is the dependent variable, rather than \\(q\\) (this is how we normally graph Supply and Demand functions!) To do this, we need to solve the above equation for \\(p\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} q\u0026amp;=100-6p \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\text{The original equation}\\\\ q+6p\u0026amp;=100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Add } 6p \\text{ to both sides}\\\\ 6p\u0026amp;=100-q \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtract } q \\text{ from both sides}\\\\ p\u0026amp;=\\frac{100}{6}-\\frac{1}{6}q \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Divide both sides by 6}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]    Functions with Fractions  Many people are rusty on a few useful algebra rules we will need, one being how to deal with fractions in equations To get rid of a fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by the fraction’s reciprocal (swap the numerator and denominator), which will yield just 1 \\[ \\begin{align*} 100\u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{4}x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\text{The equation to be solved for} x\\\\ \\frac{4}{1} \\big(\\frac{100}{1}\\big) \u0026amp;=\\frac{4}{1}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{4}x\\bigg) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Multiplying by the reciprocal of } \\frac{1}{4} \\text{, which is } \\frac{4}{1} \\\\ \\frac{400}{1}\u0026amp;=\\frac{4}{4}x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\text{Cross multiplying fractions}\\\\ 400 \u0026amp; = x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Alternatively (if possible), re-imagining the fraction as a decimal may help: \\[ \\begin{align*} 100\u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{4}x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The original equation}\\\\ 100\u0026amp;=0.25x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Converting to a decimal}\\\\ 400 \u0026amp; = x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing both sides by }0.25\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Add fractions by finding a common denominator: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\frac{4}{3} \u0026amp;+ \\frac{2}{5}\\\\ \\bigg(\\frac{4 \\times 5}{3 \\times 5}\\bigg) \u0026amp;+ \\bigg(\\frac{2 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3}\\bigg)\\\\ \\frac{20}{15}\u0026amp;+\\frac{6}{15}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{26}{15}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Multiply fractions straight across the numerator and denominator \\[ \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{4 \\times 2}{3 \\times 5}=\\frac{8}{15} \\]    Graphing Linear Functions Slope-Intercept Form  A linear function of two variables can be written in slope-intercept form: \\[y=ax+b\\]  \\(y\\) is the dependent variable (on the vertical axis) \\(x\\) is the independent variable (on the horizontal axis) \\(a\\) is the slope of the line  \\(a = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{\\text{change in }y}{\\text{change in }x} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}\\) you may have been taught the slope as “\\(m\\)”, this is just personal taste, but again, get used to using different letters!  \\(b\\) is the vertical-intercept, a constant number where the line crosses the vertical axis  if \\(y\\) is the dependent variable, this is the “\\(y\\)-intercept”, \\(y\\) where \\(x=0\\)   Any point on the line has an \\(x\\)-coordinate and \\(y\\)-coordinate \\((x_i,y_i)\\)   Other Forms  A linear function can equivalently be expressed in the following form: \\[a_1x_1+a_2x_2=c\\]  \\(x_2\\) is the dependent variable (on the vertical axis) \\(x_1\\) is the independent variable (on the horizontal axis) \\(c\\) is a constant  This is a valid equation, but is difficult to visualize in the traditional graph as above. Simply solve for the dependent variable on the vertical axis \\((x_2\\) as if you were solving for \\(y)\\):  \\[\\begin{align*} a_1x_1+a_2x_2=c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Original}\\\\ a_2x_2=c-a_1x_1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting }x_1 \\text{ term}\\\\ x_2 = \\frac{c}{a_2}-\\frac{a_1}{a_2}x_1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing by }a_2 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\n The vertical intercept is \\(\\frac{c}{a_2}\\)\n The horizontal intercept is \\(\\frac{c}{a_1}\\)\n The slope is \\(-\\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\)\n This is extremely useful for dealing with constraints in constrained optimization problems: budget constraints and isocost lines\n   Drawing a Graph From an Equation If we already have a linear equation that we would like to graph, we can follow these steps:\nTake the equation and plug in two values, e.g. if we have:  \\[p = \\frac{1}{2}q + 4\\]\nWe can find two points on the graph. The easiest one to find is the vertical-intercept, where the line crosses the vertical axis, where \\(q=0\\), so plug in \\(q=0\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} p \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(0)+4\\\\ p \u0026amp;= 4 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Thus, one point is \\((0,4)\\). Note that the constant in the function itself is the \\(p-intercept\\)! So one valid point will always be \\((0,b)\\)!\n For our second point, let’s plug in \\(q=2\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} p \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(2)+4\\\\ p \u0026amp;= 5 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Thus, another point is \\((2,5)\\)\n Now, plot the two points on the graph, and connect them with a line\n  Note: A quick shortcut to plot a line is to find the vertical intercept and plot that, and then find the next point using the slope. Here, start our line at 4 on the vertical axis, and then, as the slope is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), for every one unit increase in \\(q\\), \\(p\\) increases by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Our second point, (2,5), is a 2 unit increase in \\(q\\) resulting in a \\(1\\) unit increase in \\(p\\).\n Finding an Equation from a Graph In order to find the equation of an existing line, we follow these steps:\nFirst, take two points on the line and find the slope, \\(a\\), between them. Let’s pick \\((1,6)\\) and \\((3,2)\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Slope} \u0026amp;= \\frac{rise}{run} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{(p_2-p_1)}{(q_2-q_1)}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{(2-6)}{(3-1)}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{-4}{2}\\\\ \u0026amp;= -2\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]  There is a shortcut that we can use to find the slope faster by eye-balling the graph: When \\(q\\) changes by 1, how many units does \\(p\\) change? If we move from (1,6) to (2,5), \\(q\\) increases by 1, but \\(p\\) falls by 2. So the slope is \\(-2\\). For every one unit increase in \\(q\\), \\(p\\) changes by -2.\nNow with the slope, we need to find the vertical intercept, or \\(b\\), we solve this by plugging in the slope and any point on the graph, we will use (1,6): \\[\\begin{align*} p \u0026amp;= aq+b\\\\ (6) \u0026amp;= -2(1)+b\\\\ 6 \u0026amp;= -2+b\\\\ 8 \u0026amp;= b\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Note, there is another easy way to eye-ball what this value is. It is simply that \\(p\\) value where \\(q=0\\), or at what \\(p\\) value the graph crosses the vertical axis. We can see it is at 8.\n Thus, we have the slope and the intercept, so our equation is: \\[ p = -2q+8 \\]\n    Rates of Change If \\(y\\) changes from \\(y_1 \\rightarrow y_2\\), the difference, \\(\\Delta y = y_2-y_1\\)\n \\(\\Delta y\\) is shorthand that means “change in \\(y\\)”, NOT \\(\\Delta * y\\) (it’s not an entity itself) In calculus, the change in \\(y\\) is often written formally as \\(dy\\)  We can express the relative difference, comparing the difference with the original value of \\(y_1\\) as: \\[\\text{relative change in y}=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}=\\frac{\\Delta y}{y_1} \\]\n e.g. if \\(y_1=3\\) and \\(y_2=3.02\\), then the relative change in \\(y\\) is: \\[\\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}=\\frac{3.02-3}{3}=0.0067\\]  It’s most common to talk about the percentage change in \\(y\\) (\\(\\% \\Delta y\\)), also called the growth rate of \\(y\\), which is 100 times the relative change: \\[\\text{percentage change in y}=\\% \\Delta y = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}=\\frac{\\Delta y}{y_1}*100\\%\\]\n e.g. if \\(y_1=3\\) and \\(y_2=3.02\\), then the percentage change in \\(y\\) is: \\[\\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}*100=\\frac{3.02-3}{3}*100=0.67\\%\\]  Just move the decimal point over two digits to the right to get a percentage This is most common when we measure inflation, GDP growth rates, etc.   Natural logarithms \\((\\ln)\\) are very helpful in approximating percentage changes from \\(y_1\\) to \\(y_2\\) because: \\[100*(\\ln(y_2)-\\ln(y_1))=\\% \\Delta y = \\text{percentage change in y}\\]\nElasticity Using logs and percentage changes helps us talk about elasticity, an extremely useful concept with vast applications all over economics. Elasticity measures the percentage change in one variable (\\(y\\)) as a response to a 1% change in another (\\(x\\)) at a particular value of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \\[\\epsilon_{yx} = \\frac{\\% \\Delta y}{\\% \\Delta x}=\\cfrac{(\\frac{\\Delta y}{y})}{(\\frac{\\Delta x}{x})} =\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}*\\frac{x}{y}\\]\n Interpretation: A 1% change in \\(x\\) will lead to a \\(\\epsilon_{yx}\\)% change in \\(y\\)  For example, the price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded to a 1% change in price (at a particular price point), note here: \\(x=P\\) and \\(y=q\\): \\[\\epsilon_D = \\frac{\\%\\Delta q}{\\%\\Delta p} = \\cfrac{\\frac{\\Delta q}{q}}{\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}} =\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta p}*\\frac{p}{q}\\]\n Note that \\(\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta p}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{slope}\\) of the demand curve (which is \\(\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta q}\\)) Note though we would technically multiply by \\(\\frac{100}{100}\\) to get percentage change, this term obviously is just 1. Elasticity is unitless. Note also that on a graph we usually express \\(q\\) as our independent variable and \\(p\\) as our dependent variable   Derivatives (Calculus) Often, \\(\\Delta y\\) refers to a very small change in \\(y\\), a marginal change in \\(y\\). A rate of change is the ratio of two changes, such as the change between \\(x\\) and \\(y=f(x)\\): \\[\\frac{\\Delta f(x)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\]\n This measures how \\(f(x)\\) changes as \\(x\\) changes If \\(\\Delta\\) is infinitesimally small, then we have expressed the (first) derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\), written variously as \\(f\u0026#39;(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{df(x)}{dx}\\) \\[\\frac{d f(x)}{d x} = \\lim_ {\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\]  The derivative of a linear function \\((y=ax+b)\\) is a constant (i.e. the slope), \\(a\\) \\[\\frac{d f(x)}{d x} = a\\]\nThe derivative of the first derivative is the second derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\), denoted \\(f\u0026#39;\u0026#39;(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{d^2f(x)}{dx^2}\\)\n The second derivative measures the curvature of a function It used for proving when a function has reached a maximum or minimum, or is concave or convex (often used in #Nonlinear-Functions-\u0026amp;-Optimization)    Nonlinear Functions \u0026amp; Optimization A function is non-linear if it is curved, i.e. not a straight line. Nonlinear functions’ slopes may be different for different values of the independent variable.\nThe slope at any particular point of the function is is its first derivative, the rate of instantaneous change.\n Equivalently in practice, the value of \\(f\u0026#39;(x)\\) is the slope of a line tangent to the function at point \\((x_i, f(x_i))\\)  Most applications in economics pertain to marginal magnitudes\n Slopes mean change, and the margin implies a small change  Often describe the rate of substitution between two goods (how much \\(y\\) must you give up to get one more unit of \\(x\\))  At the limit, marginal magnitudes are derivatives of a total magnitude  e.g. Marginal cost (or revenue) is the derivative of Total Cost (or revenue) (and its slope at each value) e.g. Marginal product is the derivative of Total Product (and its slope at each value)   We can describe a curved function as being either convex or concave with respect to the origin (0,0)\nIn simplest terms, a function is concave between two points \\(a, b\\) if a straight line connecting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) lies beneath the function itself \\[\\color{red}{f[(t a)+(1-t)b]} \u0026gt; t f(a) + (1-t) f(b)\\text{ for }0 \u0026lt; t \u0026lt; 1\\]\n The above formula is a weighted average (for any set of weights \\(w\\), \\(1-w\\)), implying that the weighted average of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (dotted line in graph) is below the function The weighted average (dotted line) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is below the function A function is also concave at a point if its second derivative at that point is negative \\[\\color{blue}{f[(w a)+(1-w)b]} \u0026lt; w f(a) + (1-w) f(b) \\quad\\text{ for }0 \u0026lt; w \u0026lt; 1\\]  In simplest terms, a function is convex between two points \\(a, b\\) if a straight line connecting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) lies above the function itself \\[\\color{blue}{f[(w a)+(1-w)b]} \u0026lt; w f(a) + (1-w) f(b) \\quad \\text{ for }0 \u0026lt; w \u0026lt; 1\\] - The weighted average (dotted line) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is above the function - A function is also convex at a point if its second derivative is positive\nA function switches between convex and concave at an inflection point (point C in the example above) - Here, the second derivative (in addition to the first) is equal to 0\nOptimization For most curves, we often want to find the value where the function reaches its maximum or minimum (in general, these are types of “extrema”) along some interval\nFormally, a function reaches a maximum at \\(x^*\\) if \\(f(x^*) \\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\); or a minimum at \\(x^*\\) if \\(f(x^*) \\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) - In the graph above, the function reaches a maximum at \\(x_1\\) and a minimum at \\(x_2\\)\nThe maximum or minimum of a function occurs where the slope (first derivative) is zero, known in calculus as the “first-order condition” \\[\\frac{df(x^*)}{dx} = 0\\]\n To distinguish between maxima and minima, we have the “second-order condition”  A minimum occurs when the second derivative of the function is positive, and the curve is convex \\[\\frac{d^2f(x^*)}{dx^2} \u0026gt; 0\\] A maximum occurs when the second derivative of the function is negative, and the curve is concave \\[\\frac{d^2f(x^*)}{dx^2} \u0026lt; 0\\] An inflection point occurs where the second derivative of the function is zero All three are known as “critical points”   This is often useful for unconstrained optimization, e.g. finding the quantity of output that maximizes profits\nNote, if we have a multivariate function \\(y=f(x_1, x_2)\\) and want to find the maximum or minimum (\\(x_1^\\star, x_2^\\star\\)), the first order conditions (FOC, plural) are where all the partial derivatives (derivative with respect to \\(x_1\\) and derivative with respect to \\(x_2\\)) are zero \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial f(x_1^*, x_2^*)}{\\partial x_1} \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f(x_1^*, x_2^*)}{\\partial x_2} \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] There are second order conditions as well, to demonstrate whether an extremum is a maximum or minimum, but they are too complex to discuss here.\nOften we want to find the maximum or minimum of a function over some restricted values of \\((x_1, x_2)\\), known as constrained optimization. This is one of the most important modeling tools in microeconomics, and will show up in many contexts.\n We want to find the maximum of some function: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\max_{x_1, x_2} f(x_1, x_2)\\\\ \\text{subject to } g(x_1, x_2)=c \\\\ \\end{align*} \\]  \\(f(x_1, x_2)\\) is the “objective function” we wish to maximize (or minimize) \\(g(x_1, x_2)=c\\) is the “constraint” that limits us within some specified set of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) values   Much of microeconomic modeling is about figuring out what an agent’s objective is (e.g. maximize profits, maximize utility, minimize costs) and what their constraints are (e.g. budget, time, output).\nThere are several ways to solve a constrained optimization problem (see Appendix to Ch. 5 in textbook), the most frequent (but requiring calculus) is Lagrangian multiplier method.\nGraphically, the solution to a constrained optimization problem is the point where a curve (objective function) and a line (constraint) are tangent to one another: they just touch, but do not intersect (e.g. at point A below).\nAt the point of tangency (A), the slope of the curve (objective function) is equal to the slope of the line (constraint) - This is extremely useful and is always the solution to simple constrained optimization problems, e.g. - e.g. maximizing utility subject to income - e.g. minimizing cost subject to a certain level of output - We can find the equation of the tangent line using point slope form\n\\[y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\] - We need to know the slope \\(m\\), which we would know from the slope of the function at that point - We know \\((x_1, y_1\\)) is the point of tangency\n  Solving Systems of Equations To solve a system of simultaneous linear equations, there must be as many equations as there are variables: \\[ \\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36 \\\\ 6x-3y\u0026amp;=3 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] There are two methods we can use to solve this system:\n1. Substitution First, we take one equation and solve for one of the variables. Here, we take the first, and solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x\u0026amp;=36-4y\\\\ x\u0026amp;=3-\\frac{1}{3}y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow we take this value and plug it into the other equation:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 6x-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 6(3-\\frac{1}{3}y)-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 18-2y-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 18-5y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ -5y\u0026amp;=-15\\\\ y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we know the value of one variable, plug it into either of the original equations to solve for the value of the other variable:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+4(3)\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+12\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x\u0026amp;=24\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]\nWe should verify that our variables are correct, so plug \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into each equation and make sure it is true. Let’s start with the first equation:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12(2)+4(3)\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 24+12\u0026amp;=36 \\checkmark \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nWe can do the same with the other equation:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 6x-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 6(2)-3(3)\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 12-9\u0026amp;=3 \\checkmark \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\n 2. Elimination We will multiply the equations by constants to make the coefficients of one variable equal. Here, let us try to make the coefficients in front of each equation’s \\(x\\) equal.\n\\[\\begin{align*} [12x+4y\u0026amp;=36]*6\\\\ [6x-3y\u0026amp;=3]*12\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nTo do so, we will multiply the first equation by 6, and the second equation by 12. (We multiply each equation by the coefficient in front of the other equation’s \\(x\\) variable):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 72x+24y\u0026amp;=216\\\\ 72x-36y\u0026amp;=36 \\end{align*}\\]\nNow we subtract the second equation from the first, which should get rid of \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 72x+24y\u0026amp;=216\\\\ -[72x-36y\u0026amp;=36]\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nBe careful to distribute the minus sign carefully:\n\\[\\begin{align*} [72x-72x]+[24y-(-36y)]\u0026amp;=[216-36]\\\\ 60y\u0026amp;=180\\\\ y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we have the value of one variable, plug it in to either equation.\n\\[\\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+4(3)\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+12\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x\u0026amp;=24\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we have both variables, we can plug them in to each equation to double check them, same as before.\n  Exponents and Logarithms Exponents are defined as:\n \\(b^n=\\underbrace{b \\times b \\times ... \\times b}_{n}\\), where base \\(b\\) is multiplied by itself \\(n\\) times \\(b^0=1\\) (for \\(b \\neq 0\\))  There are some common rules for exponents, assuming \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers, \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are rational:\n\\(x^{-n}=\\frac{1}{x^n}\\)  e.g. \\(x^{-3} = \\frac{1}{x^3}\\)  \\(x^{\\frac{1}{n}}=\\sqrt[n]{x}\\)  e.g. \\(x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{x}\\)  \\(x^{(\\frac{m}{n})}=(x^{\\frac{1}{n}})^m\\)  e.g. \\(8^{\\frac{4}{3}} = (8^\\frac{1}{3})^4=2^4=16\\)  \\(x^{a}x^b=x^{a+b}\\)  e.g. \\(x^2x^3=x^5\\)  \\(\\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}\\)  e.g. \\(\\frac{x^2}{x^3}=x^{-1}=\\frac{1}{x}\\)  \\((\\frac{x}{y})^a=\\frac{x^a}{y^a}\\)  e.g. \\((\\frac{x}{y})^2=\\frac{x^2}{y^2}\\)  \\((xy)^a=x^ay^a\\)  e.g. \\((xy)^2=x^2y^2\\)   Logarithms are the exponents in the expressions above, the inverse of exponentiation\n If \\(b^y=x\\), then \\(log_b(x)= y\\)  \\(y\\) is the number you must raise \\(b\\) to in order to get \\(x\\) e.g. \\(2^6=64 = \\underbrace{(2*2*2*2*2*2)}_{\\text{6 times}}\\) so \\(log_2(64)=6\\)   We often use the natural logarithm (ln) with base \\(e=2.718...\\) in many math, statistics, and economic applications\n If \\(e^y=x\\), then \\(\\ln(x) = y\\)  There are a number of highly useful rules for natural logs:\n\\(\\ln(xy)=\\ln(x)+\\ln(y)\\)  e.g. \\(\\ln(2*3)=\\ln(2)+\\ln(3)\\)  \\(\\ln(\\frac{x}{y})=\\ln(x)-\\ln(y)\\)  e.g. \\(\\ln(\\frac{2}{3})=\\ln(2)-\\ln(3)\\)  \\(\\ln(x^a)=a*\\ln(x)\\)  e.g. \\(\\ln(x^2)=2\\ln(x)\\)    ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643137743,"objectID":"f0aa11423f3a03946d77817359b09f6a","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/math_guide/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/resources/math_guide/","section":"resources","summary":"Functions and Inverse Functions  Inverse Functions Functions with Fractions  Graphing Linear Functions  Slope-Intercept Form Other Forms Drawing a Graph From an Equation Finding an Equation from a Graph  Rates of Change  Elasticity Derivatives (Calculus)  Nonlinear Functions \u0026amp; Optimization  Optimization  Solving Systems of Equations  1.

Overview We are diving right into what is commonly called “Consumer Theory” in textbooks. While our paradigmatic example will indeed be a consumer deciding what goods and services to purchase, please recognize that this model can be applied to just about any decision made by an individual. We should more appropriately describe it as “Rational Choice Theory”. This will take several classes to fully unpack as our formal model of constrained optimization, so today we are only focusing on the constraints using the tool known as the “budget constraint.”\nWhile budget constraints are fairly straightforward, consumer theory often the most “alien” material to students of economics: preferences, indifference curves, and utility functions derived from behavioral axioms. The model we put together—constrained optimization—is borrowed from calculus and engineering. In my opinion, a good chunk of consumer theory, particularly about preferences (next class), is a waste of your time and will give you unnecessary anxiety. It’s perhaps neat for you to see how economists ground all of their models in utility-maximization, but our time is better spent on more productive things. If, however, you plan on going to graduate school for economics or social science, read this chapter, and my online appendices, in great detail.1\nAs it is still only the first week of class: if you have not done so, please watch my welcome video, read the announcements in Blackboard, take my survey, and join our class slack channel.\n  Readings   Ch. 4.3 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019  Bastiat, 1848 “What is Seen and Not Seen”, (Section 1)  Now that we are picking up the intensity and working with some models (many will be new to you at first), I recommend looking at the textbook readings before each class.\nIf you are following the textbook, we are going a bit out of order in two ways. It goes straight into (a review of principles, really) supply \u0026amp; demand in Chapters 1-3. We will ultimately get to supply and demand, but if you trust me, by the time we do later this semester, you will have a much richer understanding and appreciation for them, having understood how they represent the decisions by optimizing individuals as buyers and sellers.\nIt begins “Consumer Theory” as chapter 4.

This will help us all have a productive course together.\n   Math Appendix  Budget Constraint for \\(n\\) Goods While we can derive a lot of useful propositions and testable claims using a simple model with just 2 goods, obviously there are many orders of magnitude more goods in an economy. Economics at the graduate and professional level begins with abstract models of \\(n\\) number of goods in an economy. Naturally, we cannot graph this, so we must deal in abstract equations and set theory:\nLet \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}\\) denote the set of \\(n\\) goods in an economy. Let \\(\\{p_1,p_2, \\cdots, p_n\\}\\) denote the set of market prices affiliated with each good. Let \\(m\\) again denote an individual’s income.\nFor \\(n\\) goods, the budget set is defined as:\n\\[p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + \\cdots + p_n x_n \\leq m\\]\nWhich we can simplify, using summation notation, as:\n\\[\\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i \\leq m\\]\nTo get the limit of this set, the budget constraint, make it an equality:\n\\[\\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i = m\\] As usual, this simply says that one’s total expenditures (on all goods) on the left-hand side, must be equal to one’s income on the right-hand side.\n  And see this tweet for an 100% accurate example of what you can expect in a common Ph.D textbook discussing preferences.↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640730685,"objectID":"eab062b2028198d6033d10ca4130c899","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.2-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.2-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Optional/Referenced Readings   Practice  Slides  Assignments  Preliminary Math Survey Due Sunday August 29   Math Appendix Budget Constraint for \\(n\\) Goods    Monday, January 31, 2022    Please complete the preliminary survey!

We must now enter the more controversial — though still the overwhelming consensus view in economics — realm of modeling preferences.\nAs I mentioned in last class’ page, a lot of the “in the weeds” details about preference assumptions, indifference curves, and utility functions are a waste of your time. If you look at the textbook chapter, I am skipping a lot of “the fat,” and relegating it to an appendix at the bottom of this page. I used to spend an entire week just teaching about preferences. Again, I reiterate that if you are interested in more advanced economics training, it is essential that you master all of these details. But not for this course.\nToday we focus on the essential tools for fitting preferences into our optimization model:\n indifference curves: each of which is the set of all bundles that one is indifferent between (and that give the same amount utility) utility functions: which measure the ordinal (but not cardinal!) utility level of any given bundle; for comparisons only! marginal rate of substitution: the slope of the indifference curve, representing an individual’s subjective tradeoff between goods; measured by the ratio of marginal utilities: \\(MRS_{x,y}=-\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}\\)    Readings   Ch. 4.1-4.2 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019  Math Review Guide    Practice Answers from last class’ practice problems are posted on that page.\n  Slides Below, you can find the slides in two formats.

I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (not everything is in the slides)!\n \n Download as PDF\n  Appendix 1: Material on Preferences  Strict vs. Weak Preferences We have defined preferences as being strictly one of the following possibilities:\n\\(a \\succ b\\) (\\(a\\) is strictly preferred over b) \\(a \\prec b\\) (\\(b\\) is strictly preferred over a) \\(a \\sim b\\) (indifferent between a)  You can also have weak preferences, such as\n\\(a \\succeq b\\) (\\(a\\) is at least as preferred as (or “weakly preferred over” \\(b\\)) \\(a \\preceq b\\) (\\(b\\) is at least as preferred as (or “weakly preferred over” \\(a\\))  These are more technically complete, but it is much more simple for us to focus on strong preferences, and we don’t lose much by doing so.\n Assumptions of “Well-behaved Preferences” Reflexivity : any bundle is at least as preferred as itself\n Completeness : any two bundles can be compared\n Transitivity : rankings are logically consistent:\n   If \\(a \\succ b\\) and \\(b \\succ c\\), then \\(a \\succ c\\)  Are these good assumptions? As you will find typical in economics, very often yes, sometimes no! See the growing field of Behavioral economics for interesting anomalies and exceptions to our assumptions.\n Assumptions of “Well-behaved Indifference Curves” Like preferences, we make 4 major assumptions about indifference curves to describe the normal case. In fact, many of these assumptions are derived from the assumptions we made above about well-behaved preferences\nWe can always draw indifference curves: two bundles can always be ranked  Every possible bundle (point on graph) is on an indifference curve.\nOf course, this means that this entire graph is full of indifference curves - every single possible point is on some indifference curve (and this whole graph would just be a solid block of black). Naturally, it’s pointless to draw all the indifference curves, we just want to show a few to make our analysis meaningful. But the general idea comes from assumption 2 of preferences: any two bundles can be compared, as we can compare two points on this graph and make a judgment.\nIndifference curves are monotonic, which means practically that “more is preferred to less”  For any bundle \\(b\\) with more of at least one good than bundle \\(a \\implies a \\prec b\\). Movements to the Northeast always preferable, while movements to the Southwest always unpreferable.\nHere’s a challenge: what would indifference curves look like if one of the axes contained a bad, rather than a good? In this case, we would violate the assumption of monotonicity!\nIndifference curves are convex, which means in practice that “averages are preferred to extremes”  From experience, people generally prefer variety in their consumption. Rather than having one bundle that is “extreme” (a lot of one good and little or none of another), they tend to prefer a bundle with a better “mix” or “balance” of some of both goods.\nTake our example from class, hunting for apartments. Apartment \\(A\\) is very large but near very few friends, whereas apartment \\(B\\) is very small but near many friends. If we could find some apartment, \\(C\\), that is a weighted average of the two, with a better mix of size and friends, it would be preferred, and thus, on a higher indifference curve than \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)!\nMathematically, this feature is because indifference curves are normally convex. A function is convex when a line connecting any two points on the function lies above the function itself. Check the math review guide for more information.\nHere’s a challenge: what would non-convex (e.g. concave) curves look like, and what preferences would cause that situation?\nIndifference curves can never cross because we have assumed that preferences are transitive.  Suppose two curves crossed, as the ones below: - On the blue indifference curve, \\\\(A \\sim B\\\\) - On the orange indifference curve \\\\(B \\sim C\\\\) - But clearly \\\\(C\\\\) \\(\\succ\\) .\\\\(B\\\\) - Preferences are not transitive!\n Steepness \u0026amp; Indifference Curves for Neutrals The Steepness of indifference curves tells us how consumers trade off between goods.\nPerfectly vertical curves (left) \\(\\implies\\) indifference between having more (point B) or fewer (point A) downloads. There is no tradeoff a person would make to acquire more Downloads, they truly do not care about them at all. Thus, on the left graph, Downloads would be a neutral.\nPerfectly horizontal curves (right) \\(\\implies\\) indifference between having more (point B) or fewer (point A) Tickets. There is no tradeoff a person would make to acquire more Tickets, they truly do not care about them at all. Thus, on the right graph, Tickets would be a neutral.\nWe can look at less extreme cases:\nOn the left graph, the flatter curve implies the person is willing to give up only a few Downloads to obtain more Tickets (and vice versa). \\(MRS_{T,D}\\) (slope) is small, indicating downloads are more highly valued relative to tickets.\nOn the right graph, the steeper curve implies the person is willing to give up a lot Downloads to obtain more Tickets (and vice versa). \\(MRS_{T,D}\\) (slope) is large, indicating downloads are less valued relative to tickets.\n  Math Appendix Derivation of MRS Equation (as ratio of marginal utilities) Consider a movement along an indifference curve, how would this change affect utility? There will be a change in \\(x\\) and a change in \\(y\\), and multiplying the marginal utility of each, and adding these together will give us our total change in utility. But we know that if we are on the same indifference curve, moving along the curve will not change utility (all points on the curve are defined as having the same utility!). So rearrange the equation as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align*} MU_x \\Delta x+MU_y\\Delta y\u0026amp;= \\Delta u \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Measuring change in utility} \\\\ MU_x \\Delta x+MU_y \\Delta y \u0026amp;=0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{But change in utility is 0}\\\\ MU_y \\Delta y\u0026amp;= -MU_{x} \\Delta x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting x terms}\\\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}_{MRS} \u0026amp;= -\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing to get like terms on each side}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNotice rise over run, \\(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\), is the slope, which we have defined as the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n Utility Functions and PMTs Two utility functions \\(u(\\cdot)\\) and \\(v(\\cdot)\\) represent the same preferences iff there is a strictly increasing function \\(f\\) such that \\(v(\\cdot)=f\\left[u(\\cdot)\\right]\\)\n\\[\\begin{aligned} a\u0026amp;=(1,2)\\\\ b\u0026amp;=(2,2)\\\\ c\u0026amp;=(4,3)\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]\nThe following utility functions express the same preferences:\n  \\(u(\\cdot)\\) \\(v(\\cdot)\\)    \\(u(a)=1\\) \\(v(a)=2\\)  \\(u(b)=2\\) \\(v(b)=4\\)  \\(u(c)=3\\) \\(v(c)=6\\)    \\[v(\\cdot)=2\\left[u(\\cdot)\\right]\\]\nA positive monotonic transformation (PMT) transforms quantities such that the rank order of the quantities is preserved.\n Examples: \\(v(u)=u+2; \\, v(u)=4u; \\, v(u)=u^3; \\, v(u)=ln(u)\\)  Any PMT of a utility function contains the same preferences!\n Graphing Indifference Curves I will not ask you to formally graph indifference curves (just roughly sketch them where appropriate). If you wanted to graph them, and express them in a graphable (slope-intercept form) equation, simply solve for the good on the vertical axis.\nExample: Suppose we have a typical1 indifference curve for apples \\((a)\\) and bananas \\((b)\\): \\[u(a,b)=ab\\]\n {\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"129d15e12547a\":[\"function () \",\"plotlyVisDat\"]},\"cur_data\":\"129d15e12547a\",\"attrs\":{\"129d15e12547a\":{\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"y\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"z\":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18],[0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27],[0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45],[0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54],[0,7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63],[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72],[0,9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81]],\"alpha_stroke\":1,\"sizes\":[10,100],\"spans\":[1,20],\"type\":\"surface\",\"inherit\":true}},\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10},\"scene\":{\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"a\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"b\"},\"zaxis\":{\"title\":\"Utility\"}},\"hovermode\":\"closest\",\"showlegend\":false,\"legend\":{\"yanchor\":\"top\",\"y\":0.5}},\"source\":\"A\",\"config\":{\"showSendToCloud\":false},\"data\":[{\"colorbar\":{\"title\":\"\",\"ticklen\":2,\"len\":0.5,\"lenmode\":\"fraction\",\"y\":1,\"yanchor\":\"top\"},\"colorscale\":[[\"0\",\"rgba(68,1,84,1)\"],[\"0.0416666666666667\",\"rgba(70,19,97,1)\"],[\"0.0833333333333333\",\"rgba(72,32,111,1)\"],[\"0.125\",\"rgba(71,45,122,1)\"],[\"0.166666666666667\",\"rgba(68,58,128,1)\"],[\"0.208333333333333\",\"rgba(64,70,135,1)\"],[\"0.25\",\"rgba(60,82,138,1)\"],[\"0.291666666666667\",\"rgba(56,93,140,1)\"],[\"0.333333333333333\",\"rgba(49,104,142,1)\"],[\"0.375\",\"rgba(46,114,142,1)\"],[\"0.416666666666667\",\"rgba(42,123,142,1)\"],[\"0.458333333333333\",\"rgba(38,133,141,1)\"],[\"0.5\",\"rgba(37,144,140,1)\"],[\"0.541666666666667\",\"rgba(33,154,138,1)\"],[\"0.583333333333333\",\"rgba(39,164,133,1)\"],[\"0.625\",\"rgba(47,174,127,1)\"],[\"0.666666666666667\",\"rgba(53,183,121,1)\"],[\"0.708333333333333\",\"rgba(79,191,110,1)\"],[\"0.75\",\"rgba(98,199,98,1)\"],[\"0.791666666666667\",\"rgba(119,207,85,1)\"],[\"0.833333333333333\",\"rgba(147,214,70,1)\"],[\"0.875\",\"rgba(172,220,52,1)\"],[\"0.916666666666667\",\"rgba(199,225,42,1)\"],[\"0.958333333333333\",\"rgba(226,228,40,1)\"],[\"1\",\"rgba(253,231,37,1)\"]],\"showscale\":true,\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"y\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"z\":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18],[0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27],[0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45],[0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54],[0,7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63],[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72],[0,9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81]],\"type\":\"surface\",\"frame\":null}],\"highlight\":{\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1},\"debounce\":0},\"shinyEvents\":[\"plotly_hover\",\"plotly_click\",\"plotly_selected\",\"plotly_relayout\",\"plotly_brushed\",\"plotly_brushing\",\"plotly_clickannotation\",\"plotly_doubleclick\",\"plotly_deselect\",\"plotly_afterplot\",\"plotly_sunburstclick\"],\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Each indifference curve (or contour) is one level of utility (all points on the curve give a specific level of utility). So, set that level of utility equal to some constant, \\(k\\).\n\\[ab=k\\]\nThen, if we are putting \\(b\\) on the vertical axis, we simply solve this for \\(b\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} ab\u0026amp;=k\\\\ b\u0026amp;=\\frac{k}{a}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThis is the general equation for all indifference curves of this utility function: each utility level (value of \\(k)\\) can be graphed as an indifference curve with that equation. Thus, for example, for a utility level of \\(10\\), the equation for that indifference curve is \\[b=\\frac{10}{a}\\].\n Utility Functions for Perfect Substitutes Perfect substitutes produce straight lines for indifference curves. A straight line has a constant slope, which is interpretted as the MRS being constant - you should always be willing to substitute between the two goods at the same rate. The utility function looks like:\n\\[u(x,y)=w_xx+w_yy\\]\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). These are often known as linear preferences because the utility of the two goods are related by addition.\nNotice, having some of one good and none of the other still provides positive utility (unlike utility functions where the quantities of goods are multiplied!). This is precisely because of the substitutability between the goods!\nExample Consider 1-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{1}\\) and 2-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{2}\\). You should always be willing to substitute between one 2-Liter bottle and two 1-Liter bottles.\n\\[u_{L_{1},L_{2}}=1L_{1}+2L_{2}\\]\nThe relative weights here are 1 for 1-Liter bottles and 2 for 2-Liter bottles, because 2-Liter bottles are “worth” twice as much for you (it takes two 1-Liter bottles to match a 2-Liter bottle!).\n\\(MRS_{L_{1},L_{2}}=-\\frac{w_x}{w_y} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n  Utility Functions for Perfect Complements Perfect complements produce right angles for indifference curves. This is technically not a mathematical function, since each \\(X\\) value must be mapped to a single \\(Y\\) value (i.e. no vertical lines). Thus, the utility function for perfect complements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is quite unique:\n\\[u(x,y)=min\\{w_xx,w_yy\\}\\]\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). Utility is determined by the lesser value of what you have, \\(x\\) (weighted by \\(w_x\\)) or \\(y\\) (weighted by \\(w_y\\)). These are sometimes called “Leontief preferences”.\nThe marginal rate of substitution alternates between \\(0\\) (horizontal line) and \\(\\infty\\) (vertical line).\nExample Consider consuming hot dogs \\((H)\\) and buns \\((B)\\), that must be consumed together as a package 1:1. The utility function would be: \\[u(H,B)=min\\{H,B\\}\\]\nHaving 2 hot dogs and 3 buns only yields a utility of 2. Having 3 hot dogs and 2 buns also only yields a utility of 2.\n  Cobb-Douglas Functions Cobb-Douglas functions (both for utility and production) are one of the most common functional forms in economics. Despite their somewhat frightening presence on the surface, they have very neat mathematical properties, and have been empirically useful as well. A Cobb-Douglas function (for utility) looks like:\n\\[u(x, y)=x^a y^b\\]\nMRS and Positive Monotonic Transformations The marginal rate of substitution, using the above equation is: \\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{a x^{a-1}y^b}{b x^a y^{b-1}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{b} x^{(a-1)-a}y^{b-(b-1)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for division}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{a}{b} x^{-1}y^{1} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying exponents}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{b} \\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for negative exponents}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nUsing logarithms, we can take a positive monotonic transformation of the original utility function \\(u\\):\n\\[v(x, y)=a \\: ln \\: x + b \\: ln \\: y\\]\nThe MRS using the logarithmic form is:\n\\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{a}{x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{b}{y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{b} \\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Multiplying the righthand side by the reciprocal of the denominator,} \\frac{y}{b}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nWhich of course, is the same, because we know any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function preserves the same preferences!\n EXAMPLE Find the marginal rate of substitution for the utility function:\n\\[u(x, y) = \\sqrt{x, y}\\]\nFirst, recognize that square roots are equivalent to saying \\(x^{0.5} y^{0.5}\\). The marginal rate of substitution would be:\n\\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{0.5 x^{-0.5}y^{0.5}}{0.5x^{0.5}y^{-0.5}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{0.5}{0.5} x^{0.5-0.5}y^{0.5-(-0.5)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for division}\\\\ \u0026amp;= x^{-1}y^{1} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying exponents, and cancelling} \\frac{0.5}{0.5}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for negative exponents}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNote we could find this equivalently again by taking logs of the original utility function.\n\\[v(x,y)=0.5 \\: ln \\: x+0.5\\: ln\\: y\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{0.5}{x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{0.5}{y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Multiplying the righthand side by the reciprocal of the denominator,} \\frac{y}{0.5}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nWhich again, gives us the same marginal rate of substitution.\n    Cobb-Douglas!↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640730685,"objectID":"b4cdd589314e12794f9762b9c170c079","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.3-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.3-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Practice  Slides  Appendix 1: Material on Preferences Strict vs. Weak Preferences Assumptions of “Well-behaved Preferences” Assumptions of “Well-behaved Indifference Curves” Steepness \u0026amp; Indifference Curves for Neutrals  Math Appendix  Derivation of MRS Equation (as ratio of marginal utilities) Utility Functions and PMTs Graphing Indifference Curves Utility Functions for Perfect Substitutes  Example  Utility Functions for Perfect Complements  Example  Cobb-Douglas Functions  MRS and Positive Monotonic Transformations EXAMPLE      Wednesday, February 2, 2022    Overview From last class, we know what constraints individuals face in the market (represented by the budget constraint), but how do people make the choices they do?","tags":null,"title":"1.3 — Preferences — Class Content","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   Download PDF  Answer Key You can get music via downloads (\\(d\\)) or concert tickets (\\(t\\)).

M. Forster\n Description of Assignment  The above video can also be found on Blackboard under Class Recordings (Panopto).\n How to Write a Good Paper    How to Write a Good Paper (Slides)   See examples of good Op-eds from previous students on Blackboard (Under Course Documents)\n  Overview Your task is to write an Opinion-Editorial (Op-ed) piece that applies the economic way of thinking to some public policy-relevant issue. An op-ed is a newspaper article that expresses the opinions of a writer who is unaffiliated with the newspaper or its editorial board. Often, the writer of an op-ed has no journalism experience, or (as you will soon discover), little understanding of economics. Thus, you are at no disadvantage as a student just beginning your experience with economics and writing! To get an idea, look at any newspaper’s “Opinion” section on their website or in print.\nThe purpose of this assignment is fourfold: (1) to demonstrate to you that economics is a wonderful way of thinking about any social issue, (2) for you to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (3) to develop your writing and argumentative skills, and (4) to help you develop, change, and/or strengthen your own views by grappling with them in writing.\nIn general, am looking for a short paper that puts forth an argument and defends it. You should be able to summarize your position in one sentence – the thesis of your paper that you will argue for. It should be a reasonably original argument (it is difficult with limited knowledge to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. It should use some principle(s) or insight(s) from (micro) economics to bolster your conclusions.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. Both to disincentivize procrastination, and because I have no time to read 100 papers right before the end of class, I will stop reading and commenting on drafts after November 31\nIf you publish your op-ed in any media outlet (newspapers, news websites, major blogs) by the end of the semester, you will earn extra credit according to the following scale:1\n  Publication Examples Points    Hood-affiliated outlet The Blue and Grey, Professors’ blogs 10  Local/regional Newspaper Frederick News-Post 20  National Newspaper/blog NY Times, WaPo, WSJ, USA Today, HuffPo 40    Meeting the market test is what matters most!\nYour Op-Ed, with a word count, is due by 11:59 PM Monday December 6, via Chalk-and-Wire upload, and constitutes 20% of your final course grade.\n Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics The goal of any op-ed is to convince reasonably-educated readers of some particular conclusion (also known as a thesis). This conclusion is of course, the opinion of the author, but this opinion must be backed by theory and evidence that leads reasonable people to agree with that conclusion. The claim you make as your conclusion should be relevant, debatable, testable, and provide new insight on a topic. Telling the reader “people who do not recycle are selfish” is neither informative nor persuasive, but telling the reader “recycling reduces the amount of trash going into local landfills by X tons a year” is at least informative, if not also persuasive. You are free to take any position on any issue that you choose, so long as it is backed by evidence and sound use of the economic way of thinking. For more details, see my presentation slides linked above.\nI always hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers A and B say the same thing, but paper B says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper B is a better paper. In any event, this assignment will largely follow the style of most major newspapers. Your op-ed must be between 500 and 1000 words. You must include a word count with your final copy. There are no other formal requirements but, I recommend formatting it in 12 point Times New Roman or Arial font, double spaced, just to make it easier for me to read (and nearly every other paper you write will ask for this).\nWhile this is not a research paper, I do want you to include some scholarly sources – for example, if you cite the work of an economist on the issue, or if you use statistics, data, or facts (which you should!). While newspapers do not publish a bibliography for each op-ed, they will scrutinize every empirical claim and ask the author for sources to back it up. Thus, I would like a list of sources you used for your article, and expect you to have at least 1-3, depending on your topic and argument. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format this list, just please be consistent. Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested style.\n Suggested Topics Remember that economics is a way of analyzing the world, rather than a narrow domain of topics for studying. Thus, while you may certainly write about the typical “mundane” topics of economics we often think about (money, monopoly, inflation, etc), I strongly encourage you to apply economics to something you find much more interesting about the world - from corruption in FIFA, to the constitutional political economy of pirates, to bitcoin displacing currencies, to the illegal downloading of Game of Thrones, to the cultural institutions of the Jersey Shore, to the monopoly power of the WWE in wrestling, to the relationship of Uber \u0026amp; Airbnb to taxis and hotels, to the privatization of asteroids, to the economics of crowdfunding, to drugs, sex, and rock n roll. In fact, it is often those topics that are most eccentric and “out in left field” that make the best op-eds!\nThere are plenty of issues around us, both immediate and visible (racism and policing, college costs, ISIS, planned parenthood, gun control, etc) and latent long term issues (monetary policy and interest rates, the drug war, government spending and debt, science funding, etc).\nThe scope of topics allowed for your paper is anything that uses the economic way of thinking to make some sort of conclusion. This is an extremely wide scope, but here are a few main types of op-eds that will tend to result from this, along with some great examples of op-eds that use economics to reach an interesting or provocative conclusion.\nTaking a stand on a position, either actively being discussed in the news, or a long-standing underlying issue   The Case for Getting Rid of Borders - Completely (The Atlantic) The Racial Reality of Policing (Wall Street Journal) Zoning Out the Poor (Washington Post) This Child Doesn’t Need a Solar Panel (Wall Street Journal) How to Save Detroit (Wall Street Journal) In an Uber World, Fortune Favors the Freelancer (New York Times) What the West Gets Wrong About Russia (New York Times)  Criticizing recent statements, current popular fallacies, or policy proposals of others in the news   Shut Up Royal Baby Haters, Monarchy is Awesome (Washington Post) Trump’s Protectionist Fallacies Have Been Refuted By Free Market Economists for Hundreds of Years (Huffington Post) Trump’s Exploits Rational Ignorance (USA Today) Bernie Sanders on Immigrants: Silly, Tribal and Economically Illiterate (Newsweek) The Myth of a Stagnant Middle Class (Wall Street Journal) The ‘77 cents on the Dollar’ Myth About Women’s Pay (Wall Street Journal) How Everyone Gets the Sharing Economy Wrong (Wall Street Journal) Why Bill Gates Hates my Book (Wall Street Journal) In Zimbabwe, We Don’t Cry for Lions (New York Times)  Providing new insight into a social phenomenon that is interesting or novel, designed to get people talking   Driven to Kill: Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians they Hit (Slate) The Case for the City-State (Wall Street Journal) What Hollywood Can Teach Us About the Future of Work (New York Times) Losing is Good for You (New York Times) The $250 Econ 101 Textbook (Wall Street Journal) Cash for Kidneys: The Case for a Market for Organs (Wall Street Journal) The Bitcoin Schism Shows the Genius of Open Source (Wired) Should Physician Pay Be Tied to Performance? (Wall Street Journal)   Sources for Inspiration Here is a list of a few places you might consider to dig up some information on your topic, or to help you find a topic. Just be sure to read and cite the actual sources that these secondary sources cite.\n Major news outlets (e.g. CNN, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post, the Guardian) and wherever you may find your news (e.g. reddit, Buzzfeed, etc) both for current events, and also their Opinion/Commentary sections for other op-eds to learn from and/or critique Wikipedia – no seriously, it is the first place I go to learn about a new topic. Just be sure to actually investigate the underlying research and use that for your references! Economics Podcasts  Econtalk – a fantastic podcast series by Russ Roberts that interviews famous economists, philosophers, businesspeople, and other figures who have an impact on the world of ideas Freakonomics (Radio) – another great podcast by one of the authors of the famed Freakonomics books about intermediate-level economic topics, often an in-depth series of interviews on a major issue NPR Planet Money – another good podcast series on economics topics and current events, much shorter and more 10,000-foot level approach than Econtalk or Freakonomics  Popular Economists’ Blogs/Blogs on Economics:  Marginal Revolution – Tyler Cowen \u0026amp; Alex Tabarrok (head and shoulders above the rest!) Cafe Hayek – Don Boudreaux (libertarian-leaning, mostly just Don on trade and micro-policy) EconLog – Bryan Caplan, David Henderson (libertarian-leaning, good analysis) The Conscience of a Liberal – Paul Krugman at New York Times (strong left-wing politics) The Grumpy Economist – John Cochrane (Chicago School approach) Greg Mankiw’s Blog – Greg Mankiw (moderate conservative, New Keynesian approach) Undercover Economist – Tim Harford (British, non-political, very easy to understand) Chris Blattman – Chris Blattman (great on economic development, poverty, and conflict in poor countries) Slate Star Codex – “Scott Alexander” (a pseudonym, apparently a Medical Student, but one of the most lucid social science blogs ever written) Fivethirtyeight – Nate Silver \u0026amp; co. (a journalist, but a leader on using data and statistics in social science and journalism) Andrew Gelman – Andrew Gelman (a statistician, but another leader on using data and statistics for social science)    Grading Rubric and Deadlines Here is the rubric that I will use to grade your paper:\n  Category Points    Persuasiveness 30  Soundness 30  Clarity 20  Organization 10  References 5  Style 5  TOTAL 100     Persuasiveness: How persuasive is your argument? Would a reasonably educated college-level reader who is familiar with economics and statistics but not necessarily this course find themselves understanding your argument and agreeing with you? [Write for an audience wider than just members of this class. Therefore, don’t use terms, sources, or “inside jokes” that only other students in this class (and no one else) would understand.] Remember, your goal is not to convince me (though you may), your goal is to convince any educated reader, and I grade you the probability that this is likely. You are the lawyer, I am the judge, and your audience is the jury. Soundness: Are your theories consistent and logical, and did you apply them correctly? Did you choose relevant (and non-cherry picked) evidence to back it up? Are your facts, data, or case studies accurate? Clarity How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your research question is, how you answer it, and what your results are? Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples? Organization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding? References: Does your paper use multiple reputable references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section? Style: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice? This is somewhat subjective, and hence, the smallest portion of your grade.    Note: Websites like reddit, Buzzfeed, or personal blogs that do not require professional editorial approval do not count!↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640730685,"objectID":"9db233650904a46b218093217b62aa89","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/assignments/op-ed/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/op-ed/","section":"assignments","summary":"Description of Assignment How to Write a Good Paper Overview Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics Suggested Topics Sources for Inspiration Grading Rubric and Deadlines    Due by the end of the day Monday December 6 by CHALK-AND-WIRE UPLOAD (include a word count)    “How can I know what I think until I see what I say?” — E.

Hayek (1974 Economics Nobel Laureate)\n Microeconomic Analysis is a collection of analytical tools for modeling and understanding how decisions made by agents (individuals and firms) in a context of market institutions lead to social coordination and the creation of value. This toolkit is the analytical foundation for exploring all fields and applications of economics as a social science, has many practical applications in business, finance, politics, and insights into any realm of human endeavors. Economics, after all, is the study of human action. At the intermediate level, these concepts are made more rigorous through the use of mathematical models, but we will first and foremost lay the theoretical foundations with economic intuition. As such, this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite courses by taking principles of microeconomics (ECON 206).\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning.\nCourse Format (and Covid) As of Fall 2021, all students are expected to be on campus except those with special approved exemptions. As such, this course will be taught in-person and synchronously until or unless otherwise announced.\nYou are expected to come to class except due to medical reasons or other legitimate conflicts. Watching videos are not a substitute for attending class.1 Please see the attendance policy for more.\nIn any event that we are unable to meet in person, I will hold class meetings at the same day/time live on Zoom, and post all recorded lectures via Panopto on Blackboard, and all assignments will be submitted online (often via Blackboard).\nLearning During a Global Pandemic While we have made some progress in returning to normal, this remains a unique semester and a lot of things are still awful right now. None of us signed up for this. None of us are really okay, we’re all just pretending for everyone else.\nMany of you may be dealing with hardships at home and at work, and are generally juggling many more problems than usual. Everyone’s future plans have been completely put on hold or cancelled to a large degree.\nI am prioritizing us supporting each other as human beings during this crazy era, and will try to use simple, accessible solutions that make sense for the most people, and above all, to be flexible.\nIf you tell me you’re having trouble, I will do whatever I can to help, and not judge you or think less of you. I hope you will extend me the same courtesy.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are however always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through. If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nI want you to learn a lot from this course, but it is more important for you to remain healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning.\n  Course objectives By the end of this course, you will:\napply the models of microeconomics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) towards explaining real world behavior of individuals, firms, and governments explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance (competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures) apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues in writing  Given these objectives, this course fulfills all three of the learning outcomes for the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business Economics B.A. program:\n Use quantitative tools and techniques in the preparation, interpretation, analysis and presentation of data and information for problem solving and decision making […] Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy […] Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[…]  Fair warning: Economics is hard. This, in particular, may be of the hardest courses that you will take, primarily due to the mathematical content. Using the economic way of thinking is a skill, it is literally retraining your brain to interpret and analyze the world in a novel way, and is not something that can be memorized. I will do my best to make this class intuitive and helpful, if not interesting. If at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in higher regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR) and the Beneficial-Hodson Library.\nFree tutoring in many subjects is available for Hood students through Thinking Storm professional tutoring and Hood peer tutoring. Hood peer tutoring is located in the Tutoring Center adjacent to the Student Success Center in the Beneficial Hodson Library and Learning Commons. Appointments and online tutoring can be accessed through Blackboard and located under tools/academic tutoring. Tutoring is available evenings and weekends as well as during the day to help meet your needs. For more information about tutoring and to see the specific subject tutoring offered, please visit the student success website here or contact the student success center at studentsuccess@hood.edu.\nSee my tips for success in this course.\n Required Course materials You can find all course materials at my dedicated website for this course: microF21.classes.ryansafner.com. Links to the website are posted on our Blackboard course page. Please familiarize yourself with the website, see that it contains this syllabus, resources to help you, and our schedule. On the schedule page, you can find each module with its own class page (start there!) along with all related readings, lecture slides, practice problems, and assignments.\nMy lecture slides will be shared with you, and serve as your primary resource, but our main “textbook” below is recommended as the next best resource and will be available from the campus bookstore. I will discuss more about textbooks and materials in the first module.\nBooks Goolsbee, Austan, Steven Levitt, and Chad Syverson, 2012, Microeconomics 2nd ed, USA: Worth Publishers, ISBN: 978-1464187025  You are welcome to purchase the book by other means (e.g. Amazon, half.com, etc). I have no financial stake in requiring you to purchase this book. You are welcome to use previous version of the book, but carefully verify the reading assignments, as the material may be different across versions.\n  Assignments and Grades Your final course grade is the weighted average of the following assignments. You can find general descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page and more specific information and examples on each assignment’s page on the schedule page.\n   Frequency  Assignment  Weight      1  Opinion-Editorial  20%    5  Homeworks  20% (using average HW grade)    3  Exams  20% (each)     Each assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Letter-grade equivalents are based on the following scale:\n  Grade  Range  Grade  Range      A  93–100%  C  73–76%    A−  90–92%  C−  70–72%    B+  87–89%  D+  67–69%    B  83–86%  D  63–66%    B−  80–82%  D−  60–62%    C+  77–79%  F  \u0026lt; 60%     See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\nThese grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards \\((\\geq\\) 0.5) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of giving out grades, I merely report the grade that you earn. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time).\nSave As - PDF, or File - Export - PDF.] to **upload on Blackboard** under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph \u0026 convert them **to a single PDF**, if they are easily readable, but this is *not preferred*. See my [guide to making a PDF](https://gameF21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments) - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the `pdf` above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers). For the few questions that ask you to draw a **graph**, *try* to do so *on your computer* (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately. ## Exams There will be three exams (one at the end of each unit) including the final exam. Each exam only covers the material in its associated unit (i.e. no exam is cumulative). These exams provide feedback both to you and to me that ensures everyone is progressing on schedule and apprehending the material. This is critical, as the rest of the course, and indeed, any future economics course you take, will build off of this foundation. Exams will be released **on Blackboard** as a timed assignment. You will have 2 hours once you open the exam on Blackboard. You will not need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accommodate the difficulties of taking an exam at home. Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but the timer will continue to run once the exam is first opened. ## Opinion-Editorial Economic fallacies have always been popular, and journalists, politicians, and talking heads consistently engage in faulty economic reasoning in print and on television. Your task, as a student of economics, is to find some issue discussed in the past year, and write a critique of media discussion of that issue. Alternatively, instead of critiquing the reasoning or statements of others, you may write an advocacy piece, where you propose some economic policy and argue to persuade readers to endorse it. You will be graded both on the soundness of your economic reasoning and the quality of your writing. I would be happy to co-author an Op-Ed with anyone who writes an exemplary Op-Ed. Students who successfully publish their work in a media outlet will earn *extra credit* on their Op-Ed grade. I will provide ample resources and examples to help you accomplish this, you can find more on the associated [assignment page](assignment/op-ed).-- No extra credit is available\n Policies and Expectations This syllabus is a contract between you, the student, and me, your instructor. It has been carefully and deliberately thought out. (A syllabus can and will be used as a legal document for disputes tried at a court of law. Ask me how I know.), and I will uphold my end of the agreement and expect you to uphold yours.\nIn the language of game theory, this syllabus is my commitment device. I am a very understanding person, and I know that exceptions to rules often need to be made for students. However, to be fair to all students the syllabus artificially constrains my ability to make exceptions at a whim for anyone. This prevents clever students from exploiting my congenial personality at everyone else’s expense. Please read and familiarize yourself with the course policies and expectations of you. Chances are, if you have a question, it is answered herein.\nAttendence Your day-to-day classroom attendance is not graded. My philosophy is that you are all adults and must take ownership of your own learning or else you will not succeed. Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nHowever, as required under Hood College’s “Promise of Fall Plan,” (Ch. 2-C) your classroom attendance will be recorded at every class meeting. This is primarily to facilitate contact tracing.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy.\n Late Assignments I will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 20 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nOp-eds: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your Op-ed is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.\n Grading I will try my best to post grades on Blackboard’s Grading Center and return graded assignments to you within about one week of you turning them in. There will be exceptions. Where applicable, I will post answer keys once I know most homeworks are turned in (see Late Assignments above for penalties). Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades. See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\n Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Students must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nIn addition to in-person office hours, you can also make an appointment for “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:\n  Netiquette When using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (“Netiquette”). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X?’” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”).\n Privacy Maryland law requires all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded. If you join in, and certainly if you participate, you are consenting to be recorded. However, as described below, videos are not accessible beyond our class.\nLive lectures are recorded on Zoom and posted to Blackboard via Panopto, a secure course management system for video. Among other nice features (such as multiple video screens, close captioning, and time-stamped search functions!), Panopto is authenticated via your Blackboard credentials, ensuring that our course videos are not accessible to the open internet.\nFor the privacy of your peers, and to foster an environment of trust and academic freedom to explore ideas, do not record our course lectures or discussions. You are already getting my official copies.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents me from disclosing or discussing any student information, including grades and records about student performance. If the student is at least 18 years of age, parents (or spouses) do not have a right to obtain this information, except with consent by the student.\nMany of you may be tuning in remotely, living with parents, and may have occasional interruptions due to sharing a space. This is normal and fine, but know that I will protect your privacy and not discuss your performance when parents (or anyone other than you, for that matter) are present, without your explicit consent.\n Enrollment Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class with no penalty is Thursday, February 3. Be aware of important dates.\n Honor Code Hood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n Van Halen and M\u0026amp;Ms When you have completed reading the syllabus, email me a picture of the band Van Halen and a picture of a bowl of M\u0026amp;Ms. If you do this before the date of the first exam, you will get bonus points on the exam. If 75-100% of the class does this, you each get 2 points. If 50-75% of the class does this, you each get 4 points. If 25-50% of the class does this, you each get 6 points. If 0-25% of the class does this, you each get 8 points. Yes, you read this correctly.\n Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations College courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.\n ACBSP Information Hood College is an accredited member of the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), an organization devoted to enhancing business education. In receiving and maintaining this accreditation, the faculty has made a commitment to the continuous improvement, innovation, and scholarship of the Department of Economics and Management. For you, this means that your educational experience undergoes ongoing validation to ensure it meets the most rigorous international standards of business education. Only a select group of institutions have received this status and it is an attribute of Hood for which you should take great pride.\nPragmatically, our accreditation means that we will engage in the ongoing use of measures, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, to assess the performance of our students and the program. We ask that you take very seriously the surveys and other measurement devices we will use – your best work and honest response will help us best assess and improve our program.\n  Tentative Schedule You can find a full schedule with much more details, including the readings, appendices, and other further resources for each class meeting on the schedule page.\n  On average, even for students who complete all assignments, those that do not regularly attend class suffer by a full letter grade, (Levitt 1993).↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643137743,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Format (and Covid)  Learning During a Global Pandemic  Course objectives Required Course materials  Books  Assignments and Grades Policies and Expectations  Attendence Late Assignments Grading Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Netiquette Privacy Enrollment Honor Code Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations ACBSP Information  Tentative Schedule   Instructor  Dr. Ryan Safner  Office: Rosenstock 110  Office Hours: TBD \u0026amp; by appt  safner@hood.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
