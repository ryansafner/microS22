On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components \u0026ndash; an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.  My suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.   At least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on heuristics or memory to \u0026ldquo;fill in the blanks.\u0026rdquo; You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it\u0026rsquo;s discovered you haven\u0026rsquo;t done the reading. Do the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you \u0026ldquo;get inside my head\u0026rdquo; and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade. Work on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.^[Yes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!] As a wise woman once told me \u0026ldquo;whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.\u0026rdquo; Learn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that\u0026rsquo;s relevant in the real world.^[Yes, Google is your best friend.

Select all of the photos, and right click, and select Print. In the dialog box that pops up, select Microsoft Print to PDF in the Printer box, and then click Print. This will save it as a .pdf file in that folder. See more information.\n2. On a Mac\nAs I use a Mac, I will show you how Mac OS has a neat feature built into Finder, which allows converting multiple files into a single PDF file as a Quick Action. I have written two pages in a notebook and taken two separate pictures of them, and airdropped them onto my computer.\nHere is the  example PDF.\n3.

In its general form a function can be written as:\n\\[q = q(p)\\]\n “Quantity (\\(q\\)) is a function of price (\\(p\\))” This expresses that there is a relationship between \\(q\\) and \\(p\\), it doesn’t tell us the specific form of that relationship  \\(q\\) is the dependent or “endogenous” variable, its value is determined by \\(p\\) \\(p\\) is the independent or “exogenous” variable, its value is given and not dependent on other variables The specific form of this function might be:   \\[q = 100-6p\\]\n The numbers 100 and 6 are known as parameters, they are parts of the quantitative relationship between quantity and price (the variables) that do not change If we have values of \\(p\\), we can find the value of \\(q(p)\\):  When \\(p=10\\) \\[ \\begin{align*} q(p)\u0026amp;=100-6p\\\\ q(10)\u0026amp;=100-6(10)\\\\ q(10)\u0026amp;=100-60\\\\ q(10)\u0026amp;=40\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] When \\(p=5\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} q(p)\u0026amp;=100-6p\\\\ q(5)\u0026amp;=100-6(5)\\\\ q(5)\u0026amp;=100-30\\\\ q(5)\u0026amp;=70\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]   Multivariate functions have multiple independent variables, such as:\n\\[q=f(k,l)\\]\n “Output (\\(q\\)) is a function of both capital (\\(k\\)) and labor (\\(l\\))”\n In economics, we often restrict the domain and range of functions to positive real numbers, \\(\\mathbb{R}_+\\), since prices and quantities are never negative in the real world\n Domain: the set of \\(x\\)-values Range: the set of \\(y\\)-values determined by the function   1.1 Inverse Functions  Many functions have a useful inverse, where we switch the independent variable and dependent variable  For example, if we have the demand function: \\[q=100-6p\\] we may want find the inverse demand function, an equation where \\(p\\) is the dependent variable, rather than \\(q\\) (this is how we normally graph Supply and Demand functions!) To do this, we need to solve the above equation for \\(p\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} q\u0026amp;=100-6p \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\text{The original equation}\\\\ q+6p\u0026amp;=100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Add } 6p \\text{ to both sides}\\\\ 6p\u0026amp;=100-q \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtract } q \\text{ from both sides}\\\\ p\u0026amp;=\\frac{100}{6}-\\frac{1}{6}q \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Divide both sides by 6}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]    1.2 Functions with Fractions  Many people are rusty on a few useful algebra rules we will need, one being how to deal with fractions in equations To get rid of a fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by the fraction’s reciprocal (swap the numerator and denominator), which will yield just 1 \\[ \\begin{align*} 100\u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{4}x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\text{The equation to be solved for} x\\\\ \\frac{4}{1} \\big(\\frac{100}{1}\\big) \u0026amp;=\\frac{4}{1}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{4}x\\bigg) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Multiplying by the reciprocal of } \\frac{1}{4} \\text{, which is } \\frac{4}{1} \\\\ \\frac{400}{1}\u0026amp;=\\frac{4}{4}x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\text{Cross multiplying fractions}\\\\ 400 \u0026amp; = x \u0026amp; \u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Alternatively (if possible), re-imagining the fraction as a decimal may help: \\[ \\begin{align*} 100\u0026amp;=\\frac{1}{4}x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The original equation}\\\\ 100\u0026amp;=0.25x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Converting to a decimal}\\\\ 400 \u0026amp; = x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing both sides by }0.25\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Add fractions by finding a common denominator: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\frac{4}{3} \u0026amp;+ \\frac{2}{5}\\\\ \\bigg(\\frac{4 \\times 5}{3 \\times 5}\\bigg) \u0026amp;+ \\bigg(\\frac{2 \\times 3}{5 \\times 3}\\bigg)\\\\ \\frac{20}{15}\u0026amp;+\\frac{6}{15}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{26}{15}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Multiply fractions straight across the numerator and denominator \\[ \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{2}{5}=\\frac{4 \\times 2}{3 \\times 5}=\\frac{8}{15} \\]    2 Graphing Linear Functions 2.1 Slope-Intercept Form  A linear function of two variables can be written in slope-intercept form: \\[y=ax+b\\]  \\(y\\) is the dependent variable (on the vertical axis) \\(x\\) is the independent variable (on the horizontal axis) \\(a\\) is the slope of the line  \\(a = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{\\text{change in }y}{\\text{change in }x} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta y}\\) you may have been taught the slope as “\\(m\\)”, this is just personal taste, but again, get used to using different letters!  \\(b\\) is the vertical-intercept, a constant number where the line crosses the vertical axis  if \\(y\\) is the dependent variable, this is the “\\(y\\)-intercept”, \\(y\\) where \\(x=0\\)   Any point on the line has an \\(x\\)-coordinate and \\(y\\)-coordinate \\((x_i,y_i)\\)   2.2 Other Forms  A linear function can equivalently be expressed in the following form: \\[a_1x_1+a_2x_2=c\\]  \\(x_2\\) is the dependent variable (on the vertical axis) \\(x_1\\) is the independent variable (on the horizontal axis) \\(c\\) is a constant  This is a valid equation, but is difficult to visualize in the traditional graph as above. Simply solve for the dependent variable on the vertical axis \\((x_2\\) as if you were solving for \\(y)\\):  \\[\\begin{align*} a_1x_1+a_2x_2=c \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Original}\\\\ a_2x_2=c-a_1x_1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting }x_1 \\text{ term}\\\\ x_2 = \\frac{c}{a_2}-\\frac{a_1}{a_2}x_1 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing by }a_2 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\n The vertical intercept is \\(\\frac{c}{a_2}\\)\n The horizontal intercept is \\(\\frac{c}{a_1}\\)\n The slope is \\(-\\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\)\n This is extremely useful for dealing with constraints in constrained optimization problems: budget constraints and isocost lines\n   2.3 Drawing a Graph From an Equation If we already have a linear equation that we would like to graph, we can follow these steps:\nTake the equation and plug in two values, e.g. if we have:  \\[p = \\frac{1}{2}q + 4\\]\nWe can find two points on the graph. The easiest one to find is the vertical-intercept, where the line crosses the vertical axis, where \\(q=0\\), so plug in \\(q=0\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} p \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(0)+4\\\\ p \u0026amp;= 4 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Thus, one point is \\((0,4)\\). Note that the constant in the function itself is the \\(p-intercept\\)! So one valid point will always be \\((0,b)\\)!\n For our second point, let’s plug in \\(q=2\\): \\[ \\begin{align*} p \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2}(2)+4\\\\ p \u0026amp;= 5 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Thus, another point is \\((2,5)\\)\n Now, plot the two points on the graph, and connect them with a line\n  Note: A quick shortcut to plot a line is to find the vertical intercept and plot that, and then find the next point using the slope. Here, start our line at 4 on the vertical axis, and then, as the slope is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), for every one unit increase in \\(q\\), \\(p\\) increases by \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Our second point, (2,5), is a 2 unit increase in \\(q\\) resulting in a \\(1\\) unit increase in \\(p\\).\n 2.4 Finding an Equation from a Graph In order to find the equation of an existing line, we follow these steps:\nFirst, take two points on the line and find the slope, \\(a\\), between them. Let’s pick \\((1,6)\\) and \\((3,2)\\). \\[ \\begin{align*} \\text{Slope} \u0026amp;= \\frac{rise}{run} \\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{(p_2-p_1)}{(q_2-q_1)}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{(2-6)}{(3-1)}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{-4}{2}\\\\ \u0026amp;= -2\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]  There is a shortcut that we can use to find the slope faster by eye-balling the graph: When \\(q\\) changes by 1, how many units does \\(p\\) change? If we move from (1,6) to (2,5), \\(q\\) increases by 1, but \\(p\\) falls by 2. So the slope is \\(-2\\). For every one unit increase in \\(q\\), \\(p\\) changes by -2.\nNow with the slope, we need to find the vertical intercept, or \\(b\\), we solve this by plugging in the slope and any point on the graph, we will use (1,6): \\[\\begin{align*} p \u0026amp;= aq+b\\\\ (6) \u0026amp;= -2(1)+b\\\\ 6 \u0026amp;= -2+b\\\\ 8 \u0026amp;= b\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] Note, there is another easy way to eye-ball what this value is. It is simply that \\(p\\) value where \\(q=0\\), or at what \\(p\\) value the graph crosses the vertical axis. We can see it is at 8.\n Thus, we have the slope and the intercept, so our equation is: \\[ p = -2q+8 \\]\n    3 Rates of Change If \\(y\\) changes from \\(y_1 \\rightarrow y_2\\), the difference, \\(\\Delta y = y_2-y_1\\)\n \\(\\Delta y\\) is shorthand that means “change in \\(y\\)”, NOT \\(\\Delta * y\\) (it’s not an entity itself) In calculus, the change in \\(y\\) is often written formally as \\(dy\\)  We can express the relative difference, comparing the difference with the original value of \\(y_1\\) as: \\[\\text{relative change in y}=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}=\\frac{\\Delta y}{y_1} \\]\n e.g. if \\(y_1=3\\) and \\(y_2=3.02\\), then the relative change in \\(y\\) is: \\[\\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}=\\frac{3.02-3}{3}=0.0067\\]  It’s most common to talk about the percentage change in \\(y\\) (\\(\\% \\Delta y\\)), also called the growth rate of \\(y\\), which is 100 times the relative change: \\[\\text{percentage change in y}=\\% \\Delta y = \\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}=\\frac{\\Delta y}{y_1}*100\\%\\]\n e.g. if \\(y_1=3\\) and \\(y_2=3.02\\), then the percentage change in \\(y\\) is: \\[\\frac{y_2-y_1}{y_1}*100=\\frac{3.02-3}{3}*100=0.67\\%\\]  Just move the decimal point over two digits to the right to get a percentage This is most common when we measure inflation, GDP growth rates, etc.   Natural logarithms \\((\\ln)\\) are very helpful in approximating percentage changes from \\(y_1\\) to \\(y_2\\) because: \\[100*(\\ln(y_2)-\\ln(y_1))=\\% \\Delta y = \\text{percentage change in y}\\]\n3.1 Elasticity Using logs and percentage changes helps us talk about elasticity, an extremely useful concept with vast applications all over economics. Elasticity measures the percentage change in one variable (\\(y\\)) as a response to a 1% change in another (\\(x\\)) at a particular value of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). \\[\\epsilon_{yx} = \\frac{\\% \\Delta y}{\\% \\Delta x}=\\cfrac{(\\frac{\\Delta y}{y})}{(\\frac{\\Delta x}{x})} =\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}*\\frac{x}{y}\\]\n Interpretation: A 1% change in \\(x\\) will lead to a \\(\\epsilon_{yx}\\)% change in \\(y\\)  For example, the price elasticity of demand measures the percentage change in quantity demanded to a 1% change in price (at a particular price point), note here: \\(x=P\\) and \\(y=q\\): \\[\\epsilon_D = \\frac{\\%\\Delta q}{\\%\\Delta p} = \\cfrac{\\frac{\\Delta q}{q}}{\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}} =\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta p}*\\frac{p}{q}\\]\n Note that \\(\\frac{\\Delta q}{\\Delta p}\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{slope}\\) of the demand curve (which is \\(\\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta q}\\)) Note though we would technically multiply by \\(\\frac{100}{100}\\) to get percentage change, this term obviously is just 1. Elasticity is unitless. Note also that on a graph we usually express \\(q\\) as our independent variable and \\(p\\) as our dependent variable   3.2 Derivatives (Calculus) Often, \\(\\Delta y\\) refers to a very small change in \\(y\\), a marginal change in \\(y\\). A rate of change is the ratio of two changes, such as the change between \\(x\\) and \\(y=f(x)\\): \\[\\frac{\\Delta f(x)}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\]\n This measures how \\(f(x)\\) changes as \\(x\\) changes If \\(\\Delta\\) is infinitesimally small, then we have expressed the (first) derivative of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\), written variously as \\(f\u0026#39;(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{df(x)}{dx}\\) \\[\\frac{d f(x)}{d x} = \\lim_ {\\Delta x \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + \\Delta x)-f(x)}{\\Delta x}\\]  The derivative of a linear function \\((y=ax+b)\\) is a constant (i.e. the slope), \\(a\\) \\[\\frac{d f(x)}{d x} = a\\]\nThe derivative of the first derivative is the second derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\), denoted \\(f\u0026#39;\u0026#39;(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{d^2f(x)}{dx^2}\\)\n The second derivative measures the curvature of a function It used for proving when a function has reached a maximum or minimum, or is concave or convex (often used in #Nonlinear-Functions-\u0026amp;-Optimization)    4 Nonlinear Functions \u0026amp; Optimization A function is non-linear if it is curved, i.e. not a straight line. Nonlinear functions’ slopes may be different for different values of the independent variable.\nThe slope at any particular point of the function is is its first derivative, the rate of instantaneous change.\n Equivalently in practice, the value of \\(f\u0026#39;(x)\\) is the slope of a line tangent to the function at point \\((x_i, f(x_i))\\)  Most applications in economics pertain to marginal magnitudes\n Slopes mean change, and the margin implies a small change  Often describe the rate of substitution between two goods (how much \\(y\\) must you give up to get one more unit of \\(x\\))  At the limit, marginal magnitudes are derivatives of a total magnitude  e.g. Marginal cost (or revenue) is the derivative of Total Cost (or revenue) (and its slope at each value) e.g. Marginal product is the derivative of Total Product (and its slope at each value)   We can describe a curved function as being either convex or concave with respect to the origin (0,0)\nIn simplest terms, a function is concave between two points \\(a, b\\) if a straight line connecting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) lies beneath the function itself \\[\\color{red}{f[(t a)+(1-t)b]} \u0026gt; t f(a) + (1-t) f(b)\\text{ for }0 \u0026lt; t \u0026lt; 1\\]\n The above formula is a weighted average (for any set of weights \\(w\\), \\(1-w\\)), implying that the weighted average of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (dotted line in graph) is below the function The weighted average (dotted line) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is below the function A function is also concave at a point if its second derivative at that point is negative \\[\\color{blue}{f[(w a)+(1-w)b]} \u0026lt; w f(a) + (1-w) f(b) \\quad\\text{ for }0 \u0026lt; w \u0026lt; 1\\]  In simplest terms, a function is convex between two points \\(a, b\\) if a straight line connecting \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) lies above the function itself \\[\\color{blue}{f[(w a)+(1-w)b]} \u0026lt; w f(a) + (1-w) f(b) \\quad \\text{ for }0 \u0026lt; w \u0026lt; 1\\] - The weighted average (dotted line) of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is above the function - A function is also convex at a point if its second derivative is positive\nA function switches between convex and concave at an inflection point (point C in the example above) - Here, the second derivative (in addition to the first) is equal to 0\n4.1 Optimization For most curves, we often want to find the value where the function reaches its maximum or minimum (in general, these are types of “extrema”) along some interval\nFormally, a function reaches a maximum at \\(x^*\\) if \\(f(x^*) \\geq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\); or a minimum at \\(x^*\\) if \\(f(x^*) \\leq f(x)\\) for all \\(x\\) - In the graph above, the function reaches a maximum at \\(x_1\\) and a minimum at \\(x_2\\)\nThe maximum or minimum of a function occurs where the slope (first derivative) is zero, known in calculus as the “first-order condition” \\[\\frac{df(x^*)}{dx} = 0\\]\n To distinguish between maxima and minima, we have the “second-order condition”  A minimum occurs when the second derivative of the function is positive, and the curve is convex \\[\\frac{d^2f(x^*)}{dx^2} \u0026gt; 0\\] A maximum occurs when the second derivative of the function is negative, and the curve is concave \\[\\frac{d^2f(x^*)}{dx^2} \u0026lt; 0\\] An inflection point occurs where the second derivative of the function is zero All three are known as “critical points”   This is often useful for unconstrained optimization, e.g. finding the quantity of output that maximizes profits\nNote, if we have a multivariate function \\(y=f(x_1, x_2)\\) and want to find the maximum or minimum (\\(x_1^\\star, x_2^\\star\\)), the first order conditions (FOC, plural) are where all the partial derivatives (derivative with respect to \\(x_1\\) and derivative with respect to \\(x_2\\)) are zero \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial f(x_1^*, x_2^*)}{\\partial x_1} \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial f(x_1^*, x_2^*)}{\\partial x_2} \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] There are second order conditions as well, to demonstrate whether an extremum is a maximum or minimum, but they are too complex to discuss here.\nOften we want to find the maximum or minimum of a function over some restricted values of \\((x_1, x_2)\\), known as constrained optimization. This is one of the most important modeling tools in microeconomics, and will show up in many contexts.\n We want to find the maximum of some function: \\[ \\begin{align*} \\max_{x_1, x_2} f(x_1, x_2)\\\\ \\text{subject to } g(x_1, x_2)=c \\\\ \\end{align*} \\]  \\(f(x_1, x_2)\\) is the “objective function” we wish to maximize (or minimize) \\(g(x_1, x_2)=c\\) is the “constraint” that limits us within some specified set of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) values   Much of microeconomic modeling is about figuring out what an agent’s objective is (e.g. maximize profits, maximize utility, minimize costs) and what their constraints are (e.g. budget, time, output).\nThere are several ways to solve a constrained optimization problem (see Appendix to Ch. 5 in textbook), the most frequent (but requiring calculus) is Lagrangian multiplier method.\nGraphically, the solution to a constrained optimization problem is the point where a curve (objective function) and a line (constraint) are tangent to one another: they just touch, but do not intersect (e.g. at point A below).\nAt the point of tangency (A), the slope of the curve (objective function) is equal to the slope of the line (constraint) - This is extremely useful and is always the solution to simple constrained optimization problems, e.g. - e.g. maximizing utility subject to income - e.g. minimizing cost subject to a certain level of output - We can find the equation of the tangent line using point slope form\n\\[y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\] - We need to know the slope \\(m\\), which we would know from the slope of the function at that point - We know \\((x_1, y_1\\)) is the point of tangency\n  5 Solving Systems of Equations To solve a system of simultaneous linear equations, there must be as many equations as there are variables: \\[ \\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36 \\\\ 6x-3y\u0026amp;=3 \\\\ \\end{align*} \\] There are two methods we can use to solve this system:\n5.1 Substitution First, we take one equation and solve for one of the variables. Here, we take the first, and solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x\u0026amp;=36-4y\\\\ x\u0026amp;=3-\\frac{1}{3}y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow we take this value and plug it into the other equation:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 6x-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 6(3-\\frac{1}{3}y)-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 18-2y-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 18-5y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ -5y\u0026amp;=-15\\\\ y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we know the value of one variable, plug it into either of the original equations to solve for the value of the other variable:\n\\[ \\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+4(3)\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+12\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x\u0026amp;=24\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2\\\\ \\end{align*} \\]\nWe should verify that our variables are correct, so plug \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) into each equation and make sure it is true. Let’s start with the first equation:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12(2)+4(3)\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 24+12\u0026amp;=36 \\checkmark \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nWe can do the same with the other equation:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 6x-3y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 6(2)-3(3)\u0026amp;=3\\\\ 12-9\u0026amp;=3 \\checkmark \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\n 5.2 Elimination We will multiply the equations by constants to make the coefficients of one variable equal. Here, let us try to make the coefficients in front of each equation’s \\(x\\) equal.\n\\[\\begin{align*} [12x+4y\u0026amp;=36]*6\\\\ [6x-3y\u0026amp;=3]*12\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nTo do so, we will multiply the first equation by 6, and the second equation by 12. (We multiply each equation by the coefficient in front of the other equation’s \\(x\\) variable):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 72x+24y\u0026amp;=216\\\\ 72x-36y\u0026amp;=36 \\end{align*}\\]\nNow we subtract the second equation from the first, which should get rid of \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 72x+24y\u0026amp;=216\\\\ -[72x-36y\u0026amp;=36]\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nBe careful to distribute the minus sign carefully:\n\\[\\begin{align*} [72x-72x]+[24y-(-36y)]\u0026amp;=[216-36]\\\\ 60y\u0026amp;=180\\\\ y\u0026amp;=3\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we have the value of one variable, plug it in to either equation.\n\\[\\begin{align*} 12x+4y\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+4(3)\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x+12\u0026amp;=36\\\\ 12x\u0026amp;=24\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we have both variables, we can plug them in to each equation to double check them, same as before.\n  6 Exponents and Logarithms Exponents are defined as:\n \\(b^n=\\underbrace{b \\times b \\times ... \\times b}_{n}\\), where base \\(b\\) is multiplied by itself \\(n\\) times \\(b^0=1\\) (for \\(b \\neq 0\\))  There are some common rules for exponents, assuming \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are real numbers, \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers, and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are rational:\n\\(x^{-n}=\\frac{1}{x^n}\\)  e.g. \\(x^{-3} = \\frac{1}{x^3}\\)  \\(x^{\\frac{1}{n}}=\\sqrt[n]{x}\\)  e.g. \\(x^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{x}\\)  \\(x^{(\\frac{m}{n})}=(x^{\\frac{1}{n}})^m\\)  e.g. \\(8^{\\frac{4}{3}} = (8^\\frac{1}{3})^4=2^4=16\\)  \\(x^{a}x^b=x^{a+b}\\)  e.g. \\(x^2x^3=x^5\\)  \\(\\frac{x^a}{x^b}=x^{a-b}\\)  e.g. \\(\\frac{x^2}{x^3}=x^{-1}=\\frac{1}{x}\\)  \\((\\frac{x}{y})^a=\\frac{x^a}{y^a}\\)  e.g. \\((\\frac{x}{y})^2=\\frac{x^2}{y^2}\\)  \\((xy)^a=x^ay^a\\)  e.g. \\((xy)^2=x^2y^2\\)   Logarithms are the exponents in the expressions above, the inverse of exponentiation\n If \\(b^y=x\\), then \\(log_b(x)= y\\)  \\(y\\) is the number you must raise \\(b\\) to in order to get \\(x\\) e.g. \\(2^6=64 = \\underbrace{(2*2*2*2*2*2)}_{\\text{6 times}}\\) so \\(log_2(64)=6\\)   We often use the natural logarithm (ln) with base \\(e=2.718...\\) in many math, statistics, and economic applications\n If \\(e^y=x\\), then \\(\\ln(x) = y\\)  There are a number of highly useful rules for natural logs:\n\\(\\ln(xy)=\\ln(x)+\\ln(y)\\)  e.g. \\(\\ln(2*3)=\\ln(2)+\\ln(3)\\)  \\(\\ln(\\frac{x}{y})=\\ln(x)-\\ln(y)\\)  e.g. \\(\\ln(\\frac{2}{3})=\\ln(2)-\\ln(3)\\)  \\(\\ln(x^a)=a*\\ln(x)\\)  e.g. \\(\\ln(x^2)=2\\ln(x)\\)    ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644203441,"objectID":"f0aa11423f3a03946d77817359b09f6a","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/math_guide/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/resources/math_guide/","section":"resources","summary":"1 Functions and Inverse Functions  1.1 Inverse Functions 1.2 Functions with Fractions  2 Graphing Linear Functions  2.1 Slope-Intercept Form 2.2 Other Forms 2.3 Drawing a Graph From an Equation 2.4 Finding an Equation from a Graph  3 Rates of Change  3.1 Elasticity 3.2 Derivatives (Calculus)  4 Nonlinear Functions \u0026amp; Optimization  4.1 Optimization  5 Solving Systems of Equations  5.1 Substitution 5.","tags":null,"title":"Math Review","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"   “Whether we like it or not, it is a fact that economics cannot remain an esoteric branch of knowledge accessible only to small groups of scholars and specialists.

Overview Solving a one-time constrained optimum problem might be useful in certain contexts, but the dynamics of change are far more interesting and useful: how do people optimally respond to changes in constraints? The remaining few classes before Exam 1 are about how people respond to changes in prices and income.\nAn individual’s demand function (often just called “demand”) for a particular good describes how that person optimally responds to changes in market conditions. While in truth, many things factor into one’s demand for a good, we are simplifying the model to relate a person’s quantity demanded of a good to three things: the price of that good (“own” price), the price of other goods, and the person’s income. When we look only at the relationship between quantity demanded and the good’s price (holding constant the other two things — other prices, and income), this is the familiar demand curve you see on supply and demand graphs from principles.\nToday, we look only at how changes in income or changes in the prices of other goods can affect your quantity demanded for a good.\nIn doing so, we also introduce a major empirical tool that we will return to many times: an elasticity. You’ve seen one elasticity before: the price elasticity of demand, and probably calculated it using the “midpoint formula.” There’s a lot more to elasticity (and a lot of other kinds of elasticities!) than that. We will see two varieties today, and will spend most of a lecture on price elasticity, two class periods from now.\n  Readings   Ch. 5.1, 5.2, 5.4 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019    Practice Today we will be working on practice problems.

See the instructions for completing homeworks.    Overview Today we put all of our tools together thus far to solve the consumer’s constrained optimization problem. To solve the problem the “traditional way” would be to use Lagrangian multipliers and calculus and solve for the first order conditions. [Take the full Lagrangian equation and solve for all partial derivatives, set equal to 0.] We instead will find the solution by looking graphically, and use an algebraic rule that should make a lot of intuitive sense. That rule, equivalently expressed in two ways:\n\\[ \\begin{align*}\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y} \u0026amp;= \\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\\\ \\frac{MU_x}{p_x} \u0026amp;= \\frac{MU_y}{p_y}\\\\ \\end{align*} \\] The first rule states that the slope of the indifference curve (left) equals the slope of the budget constraint (right). This is stating that the marginal benefit of consuming \\(x\\) (left) equals the marginal cost (right) of consuming \\(y\\), and that the individual is trading off \\(y\\) for \\(x\\) at the same rate as the market is.\nThe second (version of the) rule, solved for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) terms on either side, shows that the marginal utility per dollar spent is equal across both (all) goods.\nBoth forms are often called the equimarginal rule, that at the optimum choice, the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost (which is the marginal benefit of the next best foregone opportunity).\nWe will do some practice to make sure you can solve this type of model, and then you are fully prepared for Problem Set 1.\n  Readings   Ch. 4.4-4.5 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019  Math Review Guide    Practice Today we will be working on practice problems.

Find the consumer’s optimum consumption bundle.\nThe problem can be expressed as\n\\[\\max_{x,y} xy\\] \\[s. t. 5x+10y=50\\]\nThere are a few strategies you can use to solve this problem using calculus.\nSubstitution Method: take the budget constraint and solve it for one good in terms of the other good and income. Let’s solve for \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 5x+10y\u0026amp;=50 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The budget constraint}\\\\ 5x\u0026amp;=50-10y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting } 10y \\text{ from both sides}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=10-2y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing both sides by 5}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow we can plug this in for \\(x\\) in the utility function to get an unconstrained maximization problem:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\max_{y} (10-2y)y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Plugging into the original utility function}\\\\ \\max_{y} 10y-2y^2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Distributing the }y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThen we take the derivative with respect to \\(y\\) and set it equal to zero to find the maximum value of \\(y\\) in the function.\n\\[\\begin{align*} u\u0026amp;=10y-2y^2 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The new utility function}\\\\ \\frac{d u}{d y} = 10-4y\u0026amp;=0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Taking the first derivative} \\\\ 10\u0026amp;=4y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Adding } 4y \\text{ to both sides}\\\\ 2.5\u0026amp;=y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing both sides by } 4\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow that we know \\(y\\) is 2.5. To find \\(x\\), plug 2.5 in for \\(y\\) in the first equation we found from the budget constraint:\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=10-2y \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The equation}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=10-2(2.5) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Plugging in 2.5}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=10-5 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Distributing the -2}\\\\ x\u0026amp;=5 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSo we’ve found the optimal bundle is 5 of \\(x\\) and 2.5 of \\(y\\), or (\\(x^*,y^*)=(5,2.5)\\).\nLagrangian Method: Recall the Lagrangian adds the objective function and the Lagrange multiplier \\((\\lambda)\\) times the constraint set equal to 0:\n\\[\\max_{x, y, \\lambda} \\Lambda(x, y, \\lambda)=xy+\\lambda(5x+10y-50)\\]\nSolving for the First Order Conditions (setting all partial derivatives to 0):\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\Lambda}{\\partial x} \u0026amp;= y+5\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\Lambda}{\\partial y} \u0026amp;= x+10\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\Lambda}{\\partial \\lambda} \u0026amp;= 5x+10y-50 \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nTaking the first two equations, and rearranging each to equal \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{y}{5}\u0026amp;=\\lambda \\\\ \\frac{x}{10}\u0026amp;=\\lambda \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSetting them equal to one another, and solving for \\(x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{y}{5}\u0026amp;=\\frac{x}{10} \\\\ 2y\u0026amp;=x \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSo the consumer will buy twice the amount of \\(y\\) as \\(x\\) (note this should be intuitive as \\(y\\) costs twice as much as \\(x\\)!). To find the exact amounts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) she will buy, plug what we just found into the budget constraint:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 5(2y)+10y\u0026amp;=50 \\\\ 20y\u0026amp;=50 \\\\ y\u0026amp;=2.5 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSince we now know \\(y^*\\), we can find \\(x^*\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=2y\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2(2.5)=5 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSo the optimum consumption bundle (\\(x^*, y^*\\)) again is (5,2.5).\nYou may be asking: so what in the world is \\(\\lambda\\)? Besides being instrumental in solving constrained optimization problems, the Lagrangian multiplier \\(\\lambda\\) does have some economic interpretation. First, let’s return to the FOCs, knowing \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), to solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} y+5\\lambda \u0026amp;=0\\\\ 2.5+5\\lambda \u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\lambda \u0026amp;=0.5 \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nMathematically, it can be proved that \\(\\lambda=\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial u(x,y)}{\\partial m}\\): the rate of instantaneous change in your objective function with respect to your constraint (i.e. your income). That is, if you were to change your constraint (i.e. your income) by one unit, \\(\\lambda\\) tells us how much your objective function would increase (in units of the objective function).\nEconomically, it is known as the “shadow price,” or sometimes the “marginal utility of wealth.” It tells us how much your utility would increase if you were able to increase your constraint (income) by one unit (e.g. $1). Alternatively, we can think of it as the marginal benefit of relaxing the constraint (having $1 more to spend), or the marginal cost of strengthening the constraint (having $1 less).\nIn our example, \\(\\lambda=0.5\\), so if we had one +(-)$1 in income to spend, utility would increase(decrease) by 0.5.\nRecall that since utility is ordinal and not cardinal, the number of “utils” your utility were to change by is meaningless. \\(\\lambda\\) does have meaningful quantitative interpretations when we use constrained optimization to talk about production, where units are dollars and output, rather than dollars and utility.\nLet’s lastly confirm that this is the optimum using the definition\n\\[\\begin{align*} |MRS| \u0026amp;= |\\frac{p_x}{p_y}| \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{At the optimum, slopes of I.C. and B.C. are equal}\\\\ \\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}}\u0026amp;=\\frac{p_x}{p_y} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Definition of each slope}\\\\ \\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;= \\frac{p_x}{p_y} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{MU\u0026#39;s for this specific utility function}\\\\ \\frac{(2.5)}{(5)} \u0026amp;= \\frac{5}{10} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{At optimum, } y=2.5, x=5\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} \u0026amp;= \\frac{1}{2} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\checkmark \\end{align*}\\]\n  General Case for \\(n\\) Goods \u0026amp; Marshallian Demand Functions In the case of \\(n\\) number of goods (from good \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_n)\\), the optimal consumption portfolio solves the utility maximization problem:\n\\(\\max_{x_1,\\cdots,n_n}U(x_1,\\cdots, x_n)\\) \\(s.t. \\sum^{n}_{i=1} x_ip_i \\leq m\\)\nThat is, as usual, choosing the consumption bundle that maximizes utility, subject to the budget constraint.\nUsing the Lagrangian method, the Lagrangian is:\n\\[\\mathbb{L} = U(x_i, \\cdots, x_n)+\\lambda(M - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_ip_i)\\]\nThe first order conditions are a series of \\(n+1\\) equations, with \\(n+1\\) unknowns:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_1} \u0026amp;= \\lambda p_i\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_n} \u0026amp;= \\lambda p_n\\\\ \\sum^{n}_{i=1} x_ip_i \u0026amp;= m\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSolving for each individual \\(x_i^*\\) gives us a Marshallian Demand System:\n\\[\\begin{align*} x_1^* \u0026amp;= x_1^M(p_1,\\cdots,p_n,m)\\\\ \\vdots\\\\ x_n^* \u0026amp;= x_n^M(p_1,\\cdots,p_n,m)\\\\ \\lambda^* \u0026amp;= \\lambda^M(p_1,\\cdots,p_n,m)\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nEach equation here is a demand function for that respective good, as a function of all market prices \\((p_1, \\cdots, p_n)\\) and income \\(m\\).\n  ","date":1644192000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644687787,"objectID":"4540fc3f8475c42ad4480a1f06fa9590","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.4-content/","publishdate":"2022-02-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.4-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Practice  Slides  Assignments  Problem Set 1 Due Wednesday February 16   Math Appendix  Solving the Constrained Optimization Problem with Calculus  Example  General Case for \\(n\\) Goods \u0026amp; Marshallian Demand Functions     Monday, February 7, 2022    Problem Set 1 is due by Wednesday, February 16.

We must now enter the more controversial — though still the overwhelming consensus view in economics — realm of modeling preferences.\nAs I mentioned in last class’ page, a lot of the “in the weeds” details about preference assumptions, indifference curves, and utility functions are a waste of your time. If you look at the textbook chapter, I am skipping a lot of “the fat,” and relegating it to an appendix at the bottom of this page. I used to spend an entire week just teaching about preferences. Again, I reiterate that if you are interested in more advanced economics training, it is essential that you master all of these details. But not for this course.\nToday we focus on the essential tools for fitting preferences into our optimization model:\n indifference curves: each of which is the set of all bundles that one is indifferent between (and that give the same amount utility) utility functions: which measure the ordinal (but not cardinal!) utility level of any given bundle; for comparisons only! marginal rate of substitution: the slope of the indifference curve, representing an individual’s subjective tradeoff between goods; measured by the ratio of marginal utilities: \\(MRS_{x,y}=-\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}\\)    Readings   Ch. 4.1-4.2 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019  Math Review Guide  Recommended   Munger, “What Preferences Do You Want?”  Econtalk Podcast: Michael Munger on Desires, Morality, and Self-Interest  SMBC — Economist 2     Practice Answers from last class’ practice problems are posted on that page.\n  Slides Below, you can find the slides in two formats.

As you will find typical in economics, very often yes, sometimes no! See the growing field of Behavioral economics for interesting anomalies and exceptions to our assumptions.\n Assumptions of “Well-behaved Indifference Curves” Like preferences, we make 4 major assumptions about indifference curves to describe the normal case. In fact, many of these assumptions are derived from the assumptions we made above about well-behaved preferences\nWe can always draw indifference curves: two bundles can always be ranked  Every possible bundle (point on graph) is on an indifference curve.\nOf course, this means that this entire graph is full of indifference curves - every single possible point is on some indifference curve (and this whole graph would just be a solid block of black). Naturally, it’s pointless to draw all the indifference curves, we just want to show a few to make our analysis meaningful. But the general idea comes from assumption 2 of preferences: any two bundles can be compared, as we can compare two points on this graph and make a judgment.\nIndifference curves are monotonic, which means practically that “more is preferred to less”  For any bundle \\(b\\) with more of at least one good than bundle \\(a \\implies a \\prec b\\). Movements to the Northeast always preferable, while movements to the Southwest always unpreferable.\nHere’s a challenge: what would indifference curves look like if one of the axes contained a bad, rather than a good? In this case, we would violate the assumption of monotonicity!\nIndifference curves are convex, which means in practice that “averages are preferred to extremes”  From experience, people generally prefer variety in their consumption. Rather than having one bundle that is “extreme” (a lot of one good and little or none of another), they tend to prefer a bundle with a better “mix” or “balance” of some of both goods.\nTake our example from class, hunting for apartments. Apartment \\(A\\) is very large but near very few friends, whereas apartment \\(B\\) is very small but near many friends. If we could find some apartment, \\(C\\), that is a weighted average of the two, with a better mix of size and friends, it would be preferred, and thus, on a higher indifference curve than \\(A\\) or \\(B\\)!\nMathematically, this feature is because indifference curves are normally convex. A function is convex when a line connecting any two points on the function lies above the function itself. Check the math review guide for more information.\nHere’s a challenge: what would non-convex (e.g. concave) curves look like, and what preferences would cause that situation?\nIndifference curves can never cross because we have assumed that preferences are transitive.  Suppose two curves crossed, as the ones below: - On the blue indifference curve, \\\\(A \\sim B\\\\) - On the orange indifference curve \\\\(B \\sim C\\\\) - But clearly \\\\(C\\\\) \\(\\succ\\) .\\\\(B\\\\) - Preferences are not transitive!\n Steepness \u0026amp; Indifference Curves for Neutrals The Steepness of indifference curves tells us how consumers trade off between goods.\nPerfectly vertical curves (left) \\(\\implies\\) indifference between having more (point B) or fewer (point A) downloads. There is no tradeoff a person would make to acquire more Downloads, they truly do not care about them at all. Thus, on the left graph, Downloads would be a neutral.\nPerfectly horizontal curves (right) \\(\\implies\\) indifference between having more (point B) or fewer (point A) Tickets. There is no tradeoff a person would make to acquire more Tickets, they truly do not care about them at all. Thus, on the right graph, Tickets would be a neutral.\nWe can look at less extreme cases:\nOn the left graph, the flatter curve implies the person is willing to give up only a few Downloads to obtain more Tickets (and vice versa). \\(MRS_{T,D}\\) (slope) is small, indicating downloads are more highly valued relative to tickets.\nOn the right graph, the steeper curve implies the person is willing to give up a lot Downloads to obtain more Tickets (and vice versa). \\(MRS_{T,D}\\) (slope) is large, indicating downloads are less valued relative to tickets.\n  Math Appendix Derivation of MRS Equation (as ratio of marginal utilities) Consider a movement along an indifference curve, how would this change affect utility? There will be a change in \\(x\\) and a change in \\(y\\), and multiplying the marginal utility of each, and adding these together will give us our total change in utility. But we know that if we are on the same indifference curve, moving along the curve will not change utility (all points on the curve are defined as having the same utility!). So rearrange the equation as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align*} MU_x \\Delta x+MU_y\\Delta y\u0026amp;= \\Delta u \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Measuring change in utility} \\\\ MU_x \\Delta x+MU_y \\Delta y \u0026amp;=0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{But change in utility is 0}\\\\ MU_y \\Delta y\u0026amp;= -MU_{x} \\Delta x \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting x terms}\\\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}}_{MRS} \u0026amp;= -\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing to get like terms on each side}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNotice rise over run, \\(\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}\\), is the slope, which we have defined as the marginal rate of substitution (MRS). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n Utility Functions and PMTs Two utility functions \\(u(\\cdot)\\) and \\(v(\\cdot)\\) represent the same preferences iff there is a strictly increasing function \\(f\\) such that \\(v(\\cdot)=f\\left[u(\\cdot)\\right]\\)\n\\[\\begin{aligned} a\u0026amp;=(1,2)\\\\ b\u0026amp;=(2,2)\\\\ c\u0026amp;=(4,3)\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\]\nThe following utility functions express the same preferences:\n  \\(u(\\cdot)\\) \\(v(\\cdot)\\)    \\(u(a)=1\\) \\(v(a)=2\\)  \\(u(b)=2\\) \\(v(b)=4\\)  \\(u(c)=3\\) \\(v(c)=6\\)    \\[v(\\cdot)=2\\left[u(\\cdot)\\right]\\]\nA positive monotonic transformation (PMT) transforms quantities such that the rank order of the quantities is preserved.\n Examples: \\(v(u)=u+2; \\, v(u)=4u; \\, v(u)=u^3; \\, v(u)=ln(u)\\)  Any PMT of a utility function contains the same preferences!\n Graphing Indifference Curves I will not ask you to formally graph indifference curves (just roughly sketch them where appropriate). If you wanted to graph them, and express them in a graphable (slope-intercept form) equation, simply solve for the good on the vertical axis.\nExample: Suppose we have a typical1 indifference curve for apples \\((a)\\) and bananas \\((b)\\): \\[u(a,b)=ab\\]\n {\"x\":{\"visdat\":{\"11c023d27d5a7\":[\"function () \",\"plotlyVisDat\"]},\"cur_data\":\"11c023d27d5a7\",\"attrs\":{\"11c023d27d5a7\":{\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"y\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"z\":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18],[0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27],[0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45],[0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54],[0,7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63],[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72],[0,9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81]],\"alpha_stroke\":1,\"sizes\":[10,100],\"spans\":[1,20],\"type\":\"surface\",\"inherit\":true}},\"layout\":{\"margin\":{\"b\":40,\"l\":60,\"t\":25,\"r\":10},\"scene\":{\"xaxis\":{\"title\":\"a\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":\"b\"},\"zaxis\":{\"title\":\"Utility\"}},\"hovermode\":\"closest\",\"showlegend\":false,\"legend\":{\"yanchor\":\"top\",\"y\":0.5}},\"source\":\"A\",\"config\":{\"showSendToCloud\":false},\"data\":[{\"colorbar\":{\"title\":\"\",\"ticklen\":2,\"len\":0.5,\"lenmode\":\"fraction\",\"y\":1,\"yanchor\":\"top\"},\"colorscale\":[[\"0\",\"rgba(68,1,84,1)\"],[\"0.0416666666666667\",\"rgba(70,19,97,1)\"],[\"0.0833333333333333\",\"rgba(72,32,111,1)\"],[\"0.125\",\"rgba(71,45,122,1)\"],[\"0.166666666666667\",\"rgba(68,58,128,1)\"],[\"0.208333333333333\",\"rgba(64,70,135,1)\"],[\"0.25\",\"rgba(60,82,138,1)\"],[\"0.291666666666667\",\"rgba(56,93,140,1)\"],[\"0.333333333333333\",\"rgba(49,104,142,1)\"],[\"0.375\",\"rgba(46,114,142,1)\"],[\"0.416666666666667\",\"rgba(42,123,142,1)\"],[\"0.458333333333333\",\"rgba(38,133,141,1)\"],[\"0.5\",\"rgba(37,144,140,1)\"],[\"0.541666666666667\",\"rgba(33,154,138,1)\"],[\"0.583333333333333\",\"rgba(39,164,133,1)\"],[\"0.625\",\"rgba(47,174,127,1)\"],[\"0.666666666666667\",\"rgba(53,183,121,1)\"],[\"0.708333333333333\",\"rgba(79,191,110,1)\"],[\"0.75\",\"rgba(98,199,98,1)\"],[\"0.791666666666667\",\"rgba(119,207,85,1)\"],[\"0.833333333333333\",\"rgba(147,214,70,1)\"],[\"0.875\",\"rgba(172,220,52,1)\"],[\"0.916666666666667\",\"rgba(199,225,42,1)\"],[\"0.958333333333333\",\"rgba(226,228,40,1)\"],[\"1\",\"rgba(253,231,37,1)\"]],\"showscale\":true,\"x\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"y\":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],\"z\":[[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9],[0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18],[0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27],[0,4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36],[0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45],[0,6,12,18,24,30,36,42,48,54],[0,7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63],[0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72],[0,9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81]],\"type\":\"surface\",\"frame\":null}],\"highlight\":{\"on\":\"plotly_click\",\"persistent\":false,\"dynamic\":false,\"selectize\":false,\"opacityDim\":0.2,\"selected\":{\"opacity\":1},\"debounce\":0},\"shinyEvents\":[\"plotly_hover\",\"plotly_click\",\"plotly_selected\",\"plotly_relayout\",\"plotly_brushed\",\"plotly_brushing\",\"plotly_clickannotation\",\"plotly_doubleclick\",\"plotly_deselect\",\"plotly_afterplot\",\"plotly_sunburstclick\"],\"base_url\":\"https://plot.ly\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]} Each indifference curve (or contour) is one level of utility (all points on the curve give a specific level of utility). So, set that level of utility equal to some constant, \\(k\\).\n\\[ab=k\\]\nThen, if we are putting \\(b\\) on the vertical axis, we simply solve this for \\(b\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} ab\u0026amp;=k\\\\ b\u0026amp;=\\frac{k}{a}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThis is the general equation for all indifference curves of this utility function: each utility level (value of \\(k)\\) can be graphed as an indifference curve with that equation. Thus, for example, for a utility level of \\(10\\), the equation for that indifference curve is \\[b=\\frac{10}{a}\\].\n Utility Functions for Perfect Substitutes Perfect substitutes produce straight lines for indifference curves. A straight line has a constant slope, which is interpretted as the MRS being constant - you should always be willing to substitute between the two goods at the same rate. The utility function looks like:\n\\[u(x,y)=w_xx+w_yy\\]\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). These are often known as linear preferences because the utility of the two goods are related by addition.\nNotice, having some of one good and none of the other still provides positive utility (unlike utility functions where the quantities of goods are multiplied!). This is precisely because of the substitutability between the goods!\nExample Consider 1-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{1}\\) and 2-Liter bottles of Coke \\(L_{2}\\). You should always be willing to substitute between one 2-Liter bottle and two 1-Liter bottles.\n\\[u_{L_{1},L_{2}}=1L_{1}+2L_{2}\\]\nThe relative weights here are 1 for 1-Liter bottles and 2 for 2-Liter bottles, because 2-Liter bottles are “worth” twice as much for you (it takes two 1-Liter bottles to match a 2-Liter bottle!).\n\\(MRS_{L_{1},L_{2}}=-\\frac{w_x}{w_y} = -\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n  Utility Functions for Perfect Complements Perfect complements produce right angles for indifference curves. This is technically not a mathematical function, since each \\(X\\) value must be mapped to a single \\(Y\\) value (i.e. no vertical lines). Thus, the utility function for perfect complements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is quite unique:\n\\[u(x,y)=min\\{w_xx,w_yy\\}\\]\nWhere each \\(w_i\\) is a relative weight (intensity of relative preference). Utility is determined by the lesser value of what you have, \\(x\\) (weighted by \\(w_x\\)) or \\(y\\) (weighted by \\(w_y\\)). These are sometimes called “Leontief preferences”.\nThe marginal rate of substitution alternates between \\(0\\) (horizontal line) and \\(\\infty\\) (vertical line).\nExample Consider consuming hot dogs \\((H)\\) and buns \\((B)\\), that must be consumed together as a package 1:1. The utility function would be: \\[u(H,B)=min\\{H,B\\}\\]\nHaving 2 hot dogs and 3 buns only yields a utility of 2. Having 3 hot dogs and 2 buns also only yields a utility of 2.\n  Cobb-Douglas Functions Cobb-Douglas functions (both for utility and production) are one of the most common functional forms in economics. Despite their somewhat frightening presence on the surface, they have very neat mathematical properties, and have been empirically useful as well. A Cobb-Douglas function (for utility) looks like:\n\\[u(x, y)=x^a y^b\\]\nMRS and Positive Monotonic Transformations The marginal rate of substitution, using the above equation is: \\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{a x^{a-1}y^b}{b x^a y^{b-1}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{b} x^{(a-1)-a}y^{b-(b-1)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for division}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{a}{b} x^{-1}y^{1} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying exponents}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{b} \\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for negative exponents}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nUsing logarithms, we can take a positive monotonic transformation of the original utility function \\(u\\):\n\\[v(x, y)=a \\: ln \\: x + b \\: ln \\: y\\]\nThe MRS using the logarithmic form is:\n\\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{a}{x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{b}{y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{b} \\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Multiplying the righthand side by the reciprocal of the denominator,} \\frac{y}{b}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nWhich of course, is the same, because we know any positive monotonic transformation of a utility function preserves the same preferences!\n EXAMPLE Find the marginal rate of substitution for the utility function:\n\\[u(x, y) = \\sqrt{x, y}\\]\nFirst, recognize that square roots are equivalent to saying \\(x^{0.5} y^{0.5}\\). The marginal rate of substitution would be:\n\\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\frac{0.5 x^{-0.5}y^{0.5}}{0.5x^{0.5}y^{-0.5}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{0.5}{0.5} x^{0.5-0.5}y^{0.5-(-0.5)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for division}\\\\ \u0026amp;= x^{-1}y^{1} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Simplifying exponents, and cancelling} \\frac{0.5}{0.5}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using exponent rules for negative exponents}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNote we could find this equivalently again by taking logs of the original utility function.\n\\[v(x,y)=0.5 \\: ln \\: x+0.5\\: ln\\: y\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*} MRS_{x, y} \u0026amp;=\\frac{MU_{x}}{MU_{y}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{The definition of MRS}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Using the definition of marginal utility as partial derivative}\\\\ \u0026amp;= \\cfrac{\\big(\\frac{0.5}{x}\\big)}{\\big(\\frac{0.5}{y}\\big)} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Differentiating }u \\text{ w.r.t }x \\text{ on top and }y \\text{ on bottom}\\\\ \u0026amp;=\\frac{y}{x} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Multiplying the righthand side by the reciprocal of the denominator,} \\frac{y}{0.5}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nWhich again, gives us the same marginal rate of substitution.\n    Cobb-Douglas!↩︎\n   ","date":1643760000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643818150,"objectID":"b4cdd589314e12794f9762b9c170c079","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.3-content/","publishdate":"2022-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.3-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Recommended   Practice  Slides  Appendix 1: Material on Preferences Strict vs. Weak Preferences Assumptions of “Well-behaved Preferences” Assumptions of “Well-behaved Indifference Curves” Steepness \u0026amp; Indifference Curves for Neutrals  Math Appendix  Derivation of MRS Equation (as ratio of marginal utilities) Utility Functions and PMTs Graphing Indifference Curves Utility Functions for Perfect Substitutes  Example  Utility Functions for Perfect Complements  Example  Cobb-Douglas Functions  MRS and Positive Monotonic Transformations EXAMPLE      Wednesday, February 2, 2022    Overview From last class, we know what constraints individuals face in the market (represented by the budget constraint), but how do people make the choices they do?","tags":null,"title":"1.3 — Preferences — Class Content","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"    Overview  Readings  Optional/Referenced Readings   Practice  Slides  Assignments  Preliminary Math Survey Due Sunday January 30   Math Appendix Budget Constraint for \\(n\\) Goods    Monday, January 31, 2022    Please complete the preliminary survey!    Overview We are diving right into what is commonly called “Consumer Theory” in textbooks. While our paradigmatic example will indeed be a consumer deciding what goods and services to purchase, please recognize that this model can be applied to just about any decision made by an individual. We should more appropriately describe it as “Rational Choice Theory”. This will take several classes to fully unpack as our formal model of constrained optimization, so today we are only focusing on the constraints using the tool known as the “budget constraint.”\nWhile budget constraints are fairly straightforward, consumer theory often the most “alien” material to students of economics: preferences, indifference curves, and utility functions derived from behavioral axioms. The model we put together—constrained optimization—is borrowed from calculus and engineering. In my opinion, a good chunk of consumer theory, particularly about preferences (next class), is a waste of your time and will give you unnecessary anxiety. It’s perhaps neat for you to see how economists ground all of their models in utility-maximization, but our time is better spent on more productive things. If, however, you plan on going to graduate school for economics or social science, read this chapter, and my online appendices, in great detail.1\nAs it is still only the first week of class: if you have not done so, please watch my welcome video, read the announcements in Blackboard, take my survey, and join our class slack channel.\n  Readings   Ch. 4.3 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019  Bastiat, 1848 “What is Seen and Not Seen”, (Section 1)  Math Review Guide  Now that we are picking up the intensity and working with some models (many will be new to you at first), I recommend looking at the textbook readings before each class.\nIf you are following the textbook, we are going a bit out of order in two ways. It goes straight into (a review of principles, really) supply \u0026amp; demand in Chapters 1-3. We will ultimately get to supply and demand, but if you trust me, by the time we do later this semester, you will have a much richer understanding and appreciation for them, having understood how they represent the decisions by optimizing individuals as buyers and sellers.\nIt begins “Consumer Theory” as chapter 4. It also stars with the “newer” and “weirder” stuff first — indifference curves and utility functions, and then teaches budget constraints second. I will go in the opposite order to slowly acclimate you from familiar territory (linear equations) into newer tools and concepts (nonlinear functions, multivariate functions, optimization, etc). This is also a good time to review my Math Review Guide for next week.\nThe Bastiat reading is perhaps one of the greatest economic parables ever written, and demonstrates the importance of opportunity cost in clear thinking (especially about policy).\nOptional/Referenced Readings   Safner, 2019, “Econometrics, Data Science, and Causal Inference” (blog post)     Practice Today we will be working on practice problems.

Economics at the graduate and professional level begins with abstract models of \\(n\\) number of goods in an economy. Naturally, we cannot graph this, so we must deal in abstract equations and set theory:\nLet \\(\\{x_1, x_2, \\cdots, x_n\\}\\) denote the set of \\(n\\) goods in an economy. Let \\(\\{p_1,p_2, \\cdots, p_n\\}\\) denote the set of market prices affiliated with each good. Let \\(m\\) again denote an individual’s income.\nFor \\(n\\) goods, the budget set is defined as:\n\\[p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + \\cdots + p_n x_n \\leq m\\]\nWhich we can simplify, using summation notation, as:\n\\[\\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i \\leq m\\]\nTo get the limit of this set, the budget constraint, make it an equality:\n\\[\\sum^{n}_{i=1}p_ix_i = m\\] As usual, this simply says that one’s total expenditures (on all goods) on the left-hand side, must be equal to one’s income on the right-hand side.\n  And see this tweet for an 100% accurate example of what you can expect in a common Ph.D textbook discussing preferences.↩︎\n   ","date":1643587200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643646243,"objectID":"eab062b2028198d6033d10ca4130c899","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.2-content/","publishdate":"2022-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.2-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Optional/Referenced Readings   Practice  Slides  Assignments  Preliminary Math Survey Due Sunday January 30   Math Appendix Budget Constraint for \\(n\\) Goods    Monday, January 31, 2022    Please complete the preliminary survey!

Overview Today we cover the third effect in the individual demand function: the (own) price effect, aka the law of demand: how changes in a good’s (own) price affect quantity demanded for that good.\nWe introduce the idea of (simplified, own-price) demand functions, inverse demand functions, and a demand curve. I will also show you examples of how we derive demand functions and curves.\nThe other major concept today is breaking apart the law of demand into two effects: the (real) income effect, and the substitution effect. We considering them conceptually and graphically. These can be a difficult concept for students to grasp.\n  Readings   Ch. 2.2, 5.3, in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019    Slides Below, you can find the slides in two formats.

As I find more time, I will update these and integrate them into our slides, but until then, I will just post links.\nThe first is a visual example of the static (one-time) Consumer’s problem. You can adjust things about the (Cobb-Douglas) utility function, income, and prices, and see how it would affect the graph and the optimum.\nThe second is a visual example of dynamic changes in the Consumer’s problem. The consumer starts at a pre-defined optimum. You can adjust any of the budget constraint parameters \\((m, p_x, p_y)\\), and see how it would affect a new optimum, which you can compare the the original optimum.\nThe third is a visual example of a hypothetical demand function for beer, with preference intensity, income, price of nachos (a complement), and price of wine (a substitute) as inputs to the function. Based on some pre-defined functions (in the background), you can change any of the inputs and see how it would affect the (inverse) demand function, expressed as a simple demand curve.\nI hope some time to clean these up and make a few more, such as “Visualizing the Income and Substitution Effects” and “Estimating a Demand Function from Real World Data.”\n  Appendix Example Demand Functions The examples below show how we can take a utility function and derive a demand function.\nPerfect Substitutes Recall that perfect substitutes have indifference curves that are straight lines (constant MRS), and have a utility function of: \\[u(x,y)=w_1x+w_2y\\]\nSince both the budget constraint and the indifference curves are straight lines, we will not have a point of tangency between them, but a point(s) where the lines intersect.\nThere are three possible cases,\nif \\(p_x\u0026gt;p_y\\), the slope of the budget constraint is flatter than the slope of the indifference “curves.” The optimal bundle is spending all income on good \\(x\\). if \\(p_x\u0026lt;p_y\\), the slope of the budget constraint is steeper than the slope of the indifference “curves.” The optimal bundle is spending all income on good \\(y\\). if \\(p_x=p_y\\), the budget constraint and indifference “curves” are the same line, so any point on the lines is optimal!  The first two cases are known as “corner solutions,” where a consumer chooses all of one good, and none of another. Note perfect substitutes are not convex, and violate the assumption that “averages are preferred to extremes.”\nWe can therefore write the demand function for good x (and similarly for y):\n\\[q_d^x = \\begin{cases} \\frac{m}{p_x} \u0026amp; \\text{When } p_x \u0026lt; p_y\\\\ \\text{any number between 0 and } \\frac{m}{p_x} \u0026amp; \\text{When } p_x=p_y\\\\ 0 \u0026amp; \\text{When } p_x \u0026gt; p_y\\\\ \\end{cases}\\]\nOn the graph above, since \\(p_x \u0026lt; p_y\\), the optimal consumption bundle is to spend all income on \\(x\\) at (8,0), point A.\n Perfect Complements Recall that perfect complements have indifference curves that are right angles, and have a utility function of: \\[u(x,y)=\\min \\{w_1x,w_2y\\}\\]\nThe optimal choice must always be at the corner of the indifference “curves.”\nThe consumer is purchasing equal amounts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in this example, no matter what the prices are of either, so \\(x=y\\). We must satisfy the budget constraint, that \\(p_xx+p_yx=m\\) (recall \\(y=x\\)). Solving this for \\(x\\) gives us the demand function for good x:\n\\[q_D^x=q_D^y=\\frac{m}{p_x+p_y}\\]\nThis should be intuitive: the consumer must always purchase equal amounts of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), so it’s as if the consumer was spending all of their income on a single good \\((x+y)\\) that has a price of \\((p_x+p_y)\\).\n  Cobb-Douglas Now we come to a more realistic demand function. If a consumer has a Cobb-Douglas utility function1 \\[u(x,y)= a \\ln x+ b \\ln y\\]\nThen we are solving the following constrained optimization problem:\n\\[\\max_{x,y} a \\ln x + b \\ln y\\] \\[\\text{subject to } p_xx+p_yy=m\\]\nI will solve this using the Lagrangian method.2\n\\[\\mathbb{L}=a \\: ln \\: x + b \\: ln \\: y - \\lambda(p_x x + p_y y - m)\\]\nThe First Order Conditions are:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{a}{x}-\\lambda p_x \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{b}{y}-\\lambda p_y \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = p_xx+p_yy-m \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nRearranging the first two FOCs:\n\\[\\begin{align*} a\u0026amp;=\\lambda p_x x\\\\ b\u0026amp;=\\lambda p_y y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nAdding them together:\n\\[\\begin{align*} a+b\u0026amp;=\\lambda(p_xx+p_yy)\\\\ a+b\u0026amp;=\\lambda m\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSolving for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\lambda=\\frac{a+b}{m}\\]\nSubstitute this back into each of the first two FOCs and solve for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively, to get:\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=\\frac{a}{a+b}\\frac{m}{p_x}\\\\ y\u0026amp;=\\frac{b}{a+b} \\frac{m}{p_y}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThese are the demand functions for goods \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). One of the convenient properties of Cobb-Douglas preferences is that a consumer spends a constant fraction of income \\((\\frac{a}{a+b})\\) on good \\(x\\), and the complement fraction \\((\\frac{b}{a+b})\\) on good \\(y\\)!^This becomes especially simple when the exponents \\(a+b=1\\), as in:\n\\[u(x,y)=x^ay^{(1-a)} \\quad \\quad \\text{where 0 \u0026lt; a \u0026lt; 1}\\]\nSo \\(a\\) and \\(1-a\\) are proportions of \\(m\\)!\nFor a constant value of \\(p_x\\), this is a linear function of \\(m\\). So doubling, tripling, etc. \\(m\\) will double, triple, etc. quantity demanded for \\(x\\). So the income expansion path is a straight line through the origin with a slope \\(\\frac{a}{p_x}\\).\nEXAMPLE Suppose a consumer has a utility function\n\\[u(x,y)=x^{0.5}y^{0.5}\\]\nand faces constraints of \\(m=50\\), \\(p_a=10\\), \\(p_b=5\\).\n\\[\\max_{x,y} x^{0.5}y^{0.5}\\] \\[\\text{subject to } 10x+5y=50\\]\nWrite the Lagrangian (and taking logs of the objective function, for simplicity):\n\\[\\mathbb{L} = 0.5 \\: ln \\: x+0.5 \\: ln \\: y-\\lambda(10x+5y-50)\\]\nFOCs are:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{0.5}{x}-10\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{0.5}{y}-5\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = 10x+5y-50 \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nRearrange the first two FOCs:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 0.5\u0026amp;=10 \\lambda x\\\\ 0.5\u0026amp;=5 \\lambda y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nAdd then together, and solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(10x+5y)\\\\ 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(50)\\\\ \\frac{1}{50}\u0026amp;=\\lambda\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow substitute lambda into each of the first two FOCs, solving for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), respectively:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{x}\u0026amp;=10(\\frac{1}{50})\\\\ 10x\u0026amp;=0.5(50)\\\\ x\u0026amp;=2.5\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{y}\u0026amp;=5(\\frac{1}{50})\\\\ 10x\u0026amp;=0.5(50)\\\\ y\u0026amp;=5\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThis consumer buys 2.5 units of \\(x\\) at $10/each ($25) and 5 units of \\(y\\) at $5/each ($25), spending all $50.\nRecall the utility function is\n\\[u(x, y)=\\sqrt{xy}=x^{0.5}y^{0.5}\\]\nNote the Cobb-Douglas exponents on \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are equal and sum to 1: \\((a\\) and \\(1-a=0.5)\\). So the consumer spends \\(a=50\\%\\) of her income on \\(x\\), and \\(1-a=50\\%\\) on \\(y\\).\nTo get the demand functions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), go back to the FOCs, and keep all budget constraint terms as variables \\((p_x, p_y, m)\\).\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{0.5}{x}-p_x\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial y} = \\frac{0.5}{y}-p_y\\lambda \u0026amp;= 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbb{L}}{\\partial \\lambda} = p_xx+p_yy-m \u0026amp;= 0\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nRearrange the first two FOCs:\n\\[\\begin{align*} 0.5\u0026amp;=p_x \\lambda a\\\\ 0.5\u0026amp;=p_y \\lambda y\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nAdd then together, and solve for \\(\\lambda\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(p_xx+p_yy)\\\\ 1\u0026amp;=\\lambda(m)\\\\ \\frac{1}{m}\u0026amp;=\\lambda\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSubstitute this back into each of the first two FOCs and solve for \\(x\\), and \\(y\\), respectively, to get:\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{x}-p_x\\lambda\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{x}-p_x \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{x}\u0026amp;=\\frac{p_x}{m}\\\\ p_xx\u0026amp;=0.5m\\\\ x\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{p_x}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{0.5}{y}-p_y\\lambda\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{y}-p_y \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\u0026amp;=0\\\\ \\frac{0.5}{y}\u0026amp;=\\frac{p_y}{m}\\\\ p_yy\u0026amp;=0.5m\\\\ y\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{p_y}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThese are the demand functions for \\(x\\) and for \\(y\\).3\nNote if we want to graph this, we need to find the inverse demand function by solving for \\(p_x\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*} x\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{p_x} \\\\ p_xx\u0026amp;=0.5m\\\\ p_x\u0026amp;=0.5\\frac{m}{x} \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNow we can graph a demand function for a given amount of income.

We also (re-)introduce the idea of price elasticity of demand that measures a person’s responsiveness in consumption to a change in that good’s price. However, unlike what you learned in principles1 we look at the elasticity of any point on the demand curve using a more useful formula: \\[\\epsilon_{q,p}=\\frac{1}{slope} \\times \\frac{p}{q}\\] where slope refers to the slope of the inverse demand curve (the one that we graph).\nWe will look at the key relationship between price elasticity of demand and total revenue, (Total expenditure, from the perspective of the buyer.) and work on some practice problems.\nNext class will be a review session for Exam 1, and you can mind more information about on the exam that page.\n  Readings   Ch. 2.2, 2.5, 5.5, in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019    Slides Below, you can find the slides in two formats.

What if outcomes are not guaranteed, but are uncertain (i.e. probabilistic)? Things like your health, your investments, and the integrity of your property (from theft, natural disasters, war, etc) certainly fall into this category. For this reason, we take out insurance on valuable things that have some probability of significantly losing their value. Let’s explore how Consumer Theory can make our actions more intelligible. Exchange: We have examined the case of a single individual (a consumer) making optimal choices given market prices, income, and their preferences. In one sense, an economy is just a collection of millions of these individuals all doing the same thing. But economics truly begins where at the more important stage where these individuals interact and exchange with one another. In particular, we want to examine how relative prices and income are determined in an economy (up until now we simply assumed them as given parameters). They must come from somewhere! – the interactions of individuals buying and selling with one another, responding in order to balance supply and demand. This is where the study of (general) equilibrium comes from, and what the traditional Supply and Demand model captures in its simplifications. Taxation: This handout uses consumer theory to answer a simple question: which is better for consumers, a consumption tax (tax per unit), or an equivalent income tax that raises the same amount of revenue for the government? Intertemporal Choice (TBD): All of our models thus far have only looked at present consumption and ignored any element of time. We can also look at intertemporal choice, that is, consumption decisions over time. This often touches on topics that most consider “macroeconomics,” concepts like interest rates, borrowing, lending, etc. However, these “big picture” ideas must come from actual individual decisions to consume or to save, aggregated across many individuals. Even macroeconomic theories often require “micro-foundations.” Abstract and complex concepts like interest are actually just applications of relative price theory–interest itself is a relative price of consumption today vs. consumption in the future!    Arc-price elasticity using the midpoint between two points on the demand curve: \\[\\cfrac{\\frac{q_{2}-q_{1}}{\\left(\\frac{q_{1}+q_{2}}{2}\\right)}}{\\frac{p_{2}-p_{1}}{\\left(\\frac{p_{1}+p_{2}}{2}\\right)}}\\] This actually calculates the elasticity of a single point, the one midway between \\((q_1,p_1)\\) and \\((q_2,p_2)\\).↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644687787,"objectID":"a5779e4f500a23256e377224f40afb86","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.7-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.7-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Slides  Assignments Problem Set 2 Due Monday February 21 Extra: Example Applications of Consumer Theory Models    Wednesday, February 16, 2021    Problem Set 1 is due by class time today.\nProblem Set 2 is due next Monday February 21.

For now, we are merely assuming the amount of output that is optimal, later we will explicitly solve for it as our first stage (profit maximization problem).\nIn doing so, we need to split up production activity into the short-run, where firms cannot change all inputs (we traditionally assume capital is fixed \\(\\bar{k}\\) and firms can only change labor \\(l)\\), and the long run, where firms can change all inputs. We discuss short run production and associated input-based metrics: marginal product and average product.\nIn the long-run, firms can choose many combinations of inputs \\((l,k)\\) that yield a desired output. We introduce two tools that will remind you a lot like the tools from consumer theory: (1) an isoquant curve1 that, similar to an indifference curve, contains all the combinations of inputs that yield the same output, and (2) an isocost line2 that, similar to a budget constraint, contains all the combinations of inputs that are the same total cost. We discuss some properties about each of these things and do some examples in anticipation of putting these tools together in the next class to solve the problem.\nFor some students, it takes this second time around with the tools of consumer theory for them to finally “click,” and that’s okay!\n  Readings   Ch. 6.2-6.4 in Goolsbee, Levitt, and Syverson, 2019    Slides Below, you can find the slides in two formats.

There will be a change in \\(l\\) and a change in \\(k\\), and multiplying the marginal product of each, and adding these together will give us our total change in output. But we know that if we are on the same isoquant curve, moving along the curve will not change output (all points on the curve are defined as having the same output!). So rearrange the equation as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align*} MP_l \\Delta l+MP_k\\Delta k\u0026amp;= \\Delta q \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Measuring change in output} \\\\ MP_l \\Delta l+MP_k\\Delta k\u0026amp;=0 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{But change in output is 0}\\\\ MP_k \\Delta k\u0026amp;= -MP_{l} \\Delta l \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Subtracting l terms}\\\\ \\underbrace{\\frac{\\Delta k}{\\Delta l}}_{MRTS} \u0026amp;= -\\frac{MP_{l}}{MP_{k}} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{Dividing to get like terms on each side}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nNotice rise over run, \\(\\frac{\\Delta k}{\\Delta l}\\), is the slope, which we have defined as the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS). \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n Solving the Firm’s Problem in One Step Traditionally, it is easier if we break the firm’s profit maximization problem into two stages:\nThe firm’s profit maximization problem:   Choose: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Output: \\(q\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) To Maximize: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Profit: \\(\\pi=pq-C(q)\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) written mathematically: \\[\\max_{q \\geq 0}pq-C(q)\\]  The firm’s cost minimization problem:   Choose: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Inputs: \\(l,k\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) To Minimize: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Total cost: \\(C(q)=wl+rk\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) Subject to: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Producing optimal output: \\(q^*=f(k,l)\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) written mathematically: \\[\\min_{l,k \\geq 0}pq-C(q)\\] \\[s.t. y^*=f(k,l)\\]  We proceed in class with the second stage first, and then the first stage. However, this appendix shows that the problem can be solved in a single stage. For simplicity, we look at the short run, where there is a single input \\(l\\) that can be chosen \\((\\bar{k}\\) is fixed).\nThe firm’s profit maximization problem:\n Choose: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Input and Output: \\(l,q\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) To Maximize: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Profit: \\(\\pi=pq-wl\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) Subject to: \\(\u0026lt;\\) Technology: \\(q=f(\\bar{k},l)\\) \\(\u0026gt;\\) Written mathematically: \\[\\max_{l,q \\geq 0}pq-wl\\] \\[s.t. q=f(\\bar{k},l)\\]  Objective: Maximize Profits The objective function is trying to maximize profits. So we need to think about different levels (“contour lines”) of profit that correspond to combinations of input and output (at constant prices).3\nA firm earns profits (\\(\\pi\\)) as revenues minus costs: \\[\\pi=pq-wl\\] Where - \\(q\\): quantity of output - \\(p\\): price of output - \\(w\\): price of input (wage) - \\(l\\): quantity of input (labor)\nImagine different amounts of input and output that would generate the same profit. We can think of an isoprofit line as having the equation above.\nHowever, it’s easier if we graph it as output in terms of input (our two axes for drawing the production function): \\[\\begin{align*} \\pi \u0026amp;=pq-wl\\\\ \\pi+wl\u0026amp;=pq\\\\ \\frac{\\pi}{p}+\\frac{w}{p}l\u0026amp;=q\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nFor these example isoprofit lines, since the price of our input \\((w)\\) is $1, and the price of output \\((p)\\) is $2, the slope of each of the isoprofit lines is positive \\(0.5\\).\n Constraint: Technology The constraint is what is technologically feasible for the firm to produce, according to its production function. We need to make a few assumptions about production functions in order to get an optimum solution:\n\\(q\u0026gt;0\\): firms always produce a positive amount \\(\\frac{dq}{d l}\u0026gt;0\\): The more inputs used, the more output produced (the marginal product, i.e. the slope of production function, i.e. it’s first derivative, is positive) \\(\\frac{d^2q}{d l^2}\u0026lt;0\\): Diminishing marginal productivity (production increases at a decreasing rate, i.e. the second derivative of the production function is negative)  These assumptions generate decreasing returns to scale in production: doubling input produces less than double output. These assumptions give us a mathematically-easy answer to find, but not all production fits these assumptions. A production function that fits these assumptions would look like this:\n Solving the Problem Essentially, we are trying to find the highest profit line tangent to our production function:\nAt a tangency, the slopes of the two functions are equal. The slope of the isoprofit lines we know are \\(\\frac{w}{p}\\). The slope of the production function is the marginal product (of labor). So at the point of tangency: \\[\\begin{align*} \\text{Slope of production function} \u0026amp;= \\text{Slope of Isoprofit line}\\\\ \\mathbf{MP_l}\u0026amp;\\mathbf{=\\frac{w}{p}}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\n  The Firm’s Supply and Demand Functions  The Geometry of Short-Run Production This appendix explores the geometry of production functions in the short run. From the common law of diminishing returns (sometimes called “the law of variable proportions”), with constant technology, increasing the use of one factor (e.g. \\(l)\\), holding other factors constant (e.g. \\(\\bar{k})\\), will ultimately experience diminishing returns. We often break up short-run production into three stages, based on the type of returns to increasing the use of one factor: increasing, decreasing, and negative.\nI. Increasing Returns In Stage I, labor experiences increasing returns. Both the marginal and the average product of labor are positive and (mostly) increasing. That is to say, output is increasing at an increasing rate when more labor is added, and the productivity per worker increases. For the example above, Stage I occurs over the range of 0-6 workers.\nIntuitively, increasing returns means that output increases at an increasing rate. This is not the same, but you can think of this almost like exponential growth – just by adding a few more units of input we can get massive amounts of output. If this held forever, we could grow the entire world’s supply of food in a single flower pot!\nNote that at 4 workers, marginal product reaches a maximum. Beyond this point, marginal product remains positive but begins to decrease. Looking at the production function, at 4 workers, the production function is at an inflection point. After 4 workers, the production function continues to increase, but now at a decreasing rate.\nGeometrically, what this means is that between 0-4 workers, the production function is convex (a line connecting two points is above the function), between 4-6 workers, the production function is concave (a line connecting two points is below the function), the inflection point at 4 is where it switches between convex and concave.\nStage I ends not at 4 laborers, where marginal product is maximized, but at 6 workers, where the marginal product and average product intersect (are equal).\nIn practice, most firms breeze through Stage I very quickly. Naturally, if firms can boost output a lot, and cheaply, just by adding a worker or two, they will keep hiring workers and hiring workers…\n II. Decreasing Returns In Stage II, labor experiences diminishing returns. As we discussed with the law of diminishing returns, this will eventually happen to all factors of production if you keep adding them (holding other factors constant). Now, output is increasing, but at a decreasing rate. Adding more workers will increase output, but by progressively less and less, and each worker also is less productive on average, since both average and marginal product is declining (though total product is increasing). For the example above, Stage II occurs over the range of 6-8 workers.\nStage II ends at 8 workers, where the marginal product falls to zero.\nIn practice, most firms operate in Stage II, so this range is sometimes called the ``economic region’’ of short run production. We have seen that it is in the interest of a firm to keep adding labor during Stage I. We will next see that it is disadvantageous for a firm to keep adding labor beyond Stage II. Hence, the optimal amount of labor is often somewhere in Stage II.\n III. Negative Returns In Stage III, labor experiences negative returns, that is, adding labor actually decreases output! Here we have the “too many cooks in the kitchen” phenomenon. For the example above, Stage III happens when the firm is using 8 or more workers. We can see that the marginal product is negative, and average product continues to decline, as does output.\nRecall diminishing returns implies that we are adding labor but holding all other factors (e.g. capital) constant. It is possible to increase the number of workers beyond 8 and still increase output, but that would require an increase in capital. If we do not increase capital, then by continually adding labor we will eventually hit diminishing (and negative) returns.\n    Stage Output \\(MP_l\\) \\(AP_l\\)    I \\(\\uparrow\\) at \\(\\uparrow\\) rate, then \\(\\uparrow\\) at \\(\\downarrow\\) rate \\(\\uparrow\\), then \\(\\downarrow\\) \\(\\uparrow\\)  II \\(\\uparrow\\) at \\(\\downarrow\\) rate \\(\\downarrow\\) \\(\\downarrow\\)  III \\(\\downarrow\\) Negative \\(\\downarrow\\)      The Relationship Between Marginal and Average There is a consistent relationship between any marginal magnitude and any average magnitude. We will see this when we talk about production, about costs, revenues, profits, etc.\nWhen the marginal is greater than the average, the average is increasing because the marginal “pulls up” the average. When the marginal is less than the average, the average is decreasing because the marginal “pulls down” the average. Therefore, average is neither increasing nor decreasing (reaches a maximum/minimum) when the marginal equals the average.\nThink of your grades or your GPA. Suppose your average is a B, and you get back a (marginal) grade that is an A. Since the marginal is higher than the average, this pulls up your average. Suppose instead you get back a (marginal) grade that is a C. Since the marginal is lower than the average, this pulls down your average.\n  Case \\(AP_l\\)    \\(MP_l \u0026gt; AP_l\\) \\(\\uparrow\\)  \\(MP_l = AP_l\\) Maximized  \\(MP_l \u0026lt; AP_l\\) \\(\\downarrow\\)    Look at the lower panel of the figure above and you can see, in Stage I, \\(MP_l\u0026gt;AP_l\\) and thus \\(AP_l\\) is increasing. The transition to Stage II occurs where \\(MP_l=AP_l\\) and thus \\(AP_l\\) reaches its maximum. In Stage III, \\(MP_l\u0026lt;AP_l\\) and thus \\(AP_l\\) is falling.\nIf these graphs looks vaguely familiar, cost curves (total cost, marginal cost, average cost) are monetized reciprocals of product curves (total product, marginal product, average product). Here is a proof (that will make sense a few lessons from now):\n\\[MC(q) = \\frac{ \\partial VC(q)}{\\partial q} = w \\frac{\\partial l}{\\partial q}= w \\frac{1}{MP_l}\\]\n\\[ AVC(q) = \\frac{ \\partial VC}{\\partial q} = w \\frac{l}{q}= w \\frac{1}{AP_l} \\]\nElasticity of Substitution How easy is it to substitute between labor and capital (or any inputs)? Along a single isoquant, the rate of technical substitution (MRTS) will diminish as we move to the right (more labor, less capital, i.e. the capital/labor ratio, \\(\\frac{k}{l}\\) decreases). The elasticity of substitution (often written \\(\\sigma)\\), measures the degree of responsiveness: \\[\\sigma=\\cfrac{\\% \\Delta \\left(\\frac{k}{l}\\right)}{\\% \\Delta MRTS}=\\cfrac{\\% \\Delta \\left(\\frac{k}{l}\\right)}{\\% \\Delta \\frac{MP_L}{MP_K}}\\]\nWe can measure the elasticity of substitution \\(\\sigma\\) for four common types of production functions: 1. Linear production functions \\((\\sigma=\\infty)\\) \\[q=f(l,k)=\\alpha k+\\beta l\\] 2. Fixed proportions (i.e. perfect complements, known as “Leontief” production functions): \\(\\sigma=0\\) \\[q=\\min\\{\\alpha k, \\beta l\\} \\quad \\alpha, \\beta \u0026gt;0 \\] 3. Cobb-Douglas (\\(\\sigma = 1)\\) \\[\\begin{align*} q=f(k,l)\u0026amp;=Ak^\\alpha l^\\beta \\\\ f(tk,tl) \u0026amp;= A(tk)^\\alpha (tl)^\\beta \\\\ \u0026amp;= At^{\\alpha + \\beta}k^\\alpha l ^\\beta \\\\ \u0026amp;=t^{\\alpha+\\beta}Ak^\\alpha l^\\beta \\\\ \u0026amp;=t^{\\alpha+\\beta}f(k,l)\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nHence, if \\(\\alpha+\\beta=1\\) (constant returns to scale),\nConstant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function: \\[q=f(k,l)=[k^\\rho + l^\\rho]^{\\frac{\\gamma}{\\rho}}\\]  Where \\(\\sigma=\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}\\) - For \\(\\gamma \u0026gt;1\\): increasing returns - For \\(\\gamma \u0026lt;1\\): decreasing returns\nIncorporates all three previous cases: 1.

How does it affect the cost-minimizing (optimal) combination of inputs?\nIt turns out, a change in one input’s price relative to the other is likely to change the ratio of inputs, as well as the total cost of production due to the mathematics and geometry of cost minimization. Recall the cost-minimizing combination of inputs occurs where the slope of the isoquant is equal to the slope of the lowest isocost line tangent to the isoquant. In the graph below, this occurs at point \\(A\\).\nThen, suppose the price of labor \\(w\\) increases from $2 to $4. This causes a move along the isoquant from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), the firm substitutes more capital for labor, and this costs more!\nWhy does the optimal isocost line rotate along both axes (i.e. both axis-endpoints change)? With the budget constraint, we saw a change in one price caused the budget constraint to rotate and change an endpoint only along the axis with the good that changed in price.\nHere, recall that the isoquant is unmovable - this is the set optimal quantity we want to produce. If an input were to change in price, that would rotate the isocost line and change only the intercept of that input that changed in price, as with a budget constraint. However, that new line (dashed darker red line) would not be tangent to our original budget constraint anymore - that is, we could not produce the output we want at the same total cost as before. Thus, it must be on a new isocost line (indicating a different total cost), just with the same slope as the new isocost line after the price change.\nNote you could also go in the other direction. Begin at point \\(B\\) and suppose the price of labor decreases (or perhaps the price of capital increases). Then, the firm will substitute more labor for capital, and this will cost less!\n Improvements in Technology We defined our original production function as including an “input” called “total factor productivity.” In our Cobb-Douglas case, we included it in our function as \\(A\\), as in: \\[q=Ak^\\alpha l^\\beta\\]\nNow let’s see how this affects production. Suppose the firm wants to produce 100 units of output at a particular set of input prices, with the following technology (represented by the production function): \\[q=k^{0.5}l^{0.5}\\] Then the firm’s “technology” improves, such that its new production function is\n\\[q=2k^{0.5}l^{0.5}\\]\nNotice total factor productivity \\((A)\\) has doubled, such that, for the same amount of inputs \\(l\\) and \\(k\\), the firm can now produce twice as much output \\((2q)\\). So suppose again the firm still wishes to produce \\(q^*=100\\), the same as before. Under the new technology, the firm can produce the same output with fewer inputs. This is the definition of productivity increases or, for an entire economy, economic growth.\n Returns to Scale: Proof of Exponents Trick Consider a Cobb-Douglas production function \\[f(k,l) =k^\\alpha l^\\beta\\]\nNow scale this function by some scalar \\(t\u0026gt;0\\), by multiplying both \\(l\\) and \\(k\\), and also output \\(q\\), by \\(t\\): \\[\\begin{align*} tq\u0026amp; \\lesseqgtr (tk)^\\alpha (tl)^\\beta \\\\ tq\u0026amp; \\lesseqgtr t^{\\alpha+\\beta}k^\\alpha l^\\beta \\\\ tq\u0026amp; \\lesseqgtr t^{\\alpha+\\beta}f(l,k) \\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nThis implies that: \\[\\begin{cases} tq\u0026gt;t^{\\alpha+\\beta}f(l,k) \u0026amp; \\iff \\alpha+\\beta \u0026lt; 1 \u0026amp; \\text{Decreasing returns to scale}\\\\ tq=t^{\\alpha+\\beta}f(l,k) \u0026amp; \\iff \\alpha+\\beta = 1 \u0026amp; \\text{Constant returns to scale}\\\\ tq\u0026lt;t^{\\alpha+\\beta}f(l,k) \u0026amp; \\iff \\alpha+\\beta \u0026gt; 1 \u0026amp; \\text{Increasing returns to scale}\\\\ \\end{cases}\\]\n  ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647738965,"objectID":"ad5a3aa08c565b62bae597bfe8b9574b","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/2.3-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/2.3-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Slides  Practice  Assignments Problem Set 3 Due Monday March 21  Appendix  A Change in Relative Factor Prices Improvements in Technology Returns to Scale: Proof of Exponents Trick     Monday, March 7, 2022    Problem Set 3 is due by Monday March 21.

This is easiest to see for a single input, such as our assumptions of the short run (where firms can change \\(l\\) but not \\(\\bar{k})\\):\n\\[q=f(\\bar{k},l)\\]\n Constant Returns to Scale:  Decreasing Returns to Scale  Increasing Returns to Scale  Cobb-Douglas Cost Functions The total cost function for Cobb-Douglas production functions of the form \\[q=l^{\\alpha}k^{\\beta}\\] can be shown with some very tedious algebra to be:\n\\[C(w,r,q)=\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}} + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}\\right)^{\\frac{-\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\\right] w^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}} r^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}} q^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\\]\nIf you take the first derivative of this (to get marginal cost), it is:\n\\[\\frac{\\partial C(w,r,q)}{\\partial q}= MC(q) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\left(w^{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}} r^{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\\right) q^{\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\right)-1}\\]\nHow does marginal cost change with increased output?

This also makes graphs quite easy to point to and calculate key areas, such as profits or deadweight losses.\nOne common set of cost assumptions is the following:\nA firm has no fixed costs A firm has constant marginal costs, \\(MC(q)=c\\) where \\(c\\geq0\\)  If this is the case, then we can show that average costs will be equal to marginal costs, i.e. \\(MC=AC=AVC=c\\).\nSince marginal cost is the first derivative of the total cost function, integrating a marginal cost function \\(MC=c\\) leaves with with a total cost function of \\(C(q)=cq\\).1 If this is the case, then we can find the average cost:\n\\[\\begin{align*} C(q)\u0026amp;=cq\\\\ AC(q)=\\frac{C(q)}{q}\u0026amp;=\\frac{cq}{q}\\\\ AC(q)\u0026amp;=c\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nAnother common set of cost assumptions is the following:\nA firm has fixed costs, \\(f\\) A firm has constant marginal costs, \\(MC(q)=c\\) where \\(c\\geq0\\)  If this is the case, then we can show that average costs are strictly decreasing over all output \\(q\\geq0\\).\nAgain, we can integrate marginal cost to the total cost function (but here we need the arbitrary constant from integration, which we shall label \\(f\\), for fixed costs): \\(C(q)=cq+f\\). We can then find the average cost:\n\\[\\begin{align*} C(q)\u0026amp;=cq+f\\\\ AC(q)=\\frac{C(q)}{q}\u0026amp;=\\frac{cq+f}{q}\\\\ AC(q)\u0026amp;=c+\\frac{f}{q}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\]\nSince \\(f\u0026gt;0\\), as \\(q \\rightarrow \\infty\\), \\(AC(q) \\rightarrow c\\), that is, average cost is getting asymptotically close to marginal cost, \\(c\\), but will never intersect it. Note, I also included AFC, which again is always decreasing, and asymptotically approaching 0.\nThe importance of this type of cost structure is that it creates economies of scale, and represents a lot of industries that tend towards natural monopoly.\n   Since we assumed there are no fixed costs, then there is no arbitrary constant from integration.↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647829255,"objectID":"bc46232eb5ef6a58a23767cd86692b0d","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/content/2.5-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/2.5-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Slides  Practice   Assignments Problem Set 4 Due Wed Mar 31  Appendix Common Cost Assumptions     Wednesday, March 23, 2022    Problem Set 4 is due by the end of the day Wednesday March 31.\nExam 2 will be on Monday April 4.

I write questions such that you can get a perfect score without a calculator, and answers should typically be simple whole numbers. However, I understand that if nothing else, calculators are moral support and you can use them. I will provide simple calculators if you need to borrow one, as well as extra paper.\nI write the exam so that most students can complete it in less than the required time, but you will have the whole class period, plus a few minutes between classes. Questions draw from concepts in the slides and whatever we discuss in class, no other outside knowledge is needed.\nYou may need to draw graphs — I will grade you based on labeling important points, not on drawing ability or perfect accuracy.\nYou must show your work for all problems. On all exam questions, I give points for partial credit. The more of your thought process you show (if you are unsure), the more points I am able to give. Both correct answers with no work shown, or blank answers will not receive full points.\nPlease plan to come in and leave a seat between you and your neighbor.\nIf you have any approved testing accommodations, or know in advance you must be absent, please confirm with me ASAP and we will make arrangements.\n Concepts Study Guide   Download PDF  Note that we skipped some excess content about preferences this semester, so some things on the study guide (like assumptions about preferences, assumptions about indifference curves, indifference curves for non-goods – the graph on page 5, steepness –graph on page 7–but know complements \u0026amp; substitutes!), you can safely ignore.\n “Practice” Exam   Download Old Exam 1  Answer Key  Above, you have a previous semester’s actual exam. Use it to get a sense of what questions are asked, the format, and how many. The exact number and type of questions on our exam may be different. For example, this semester we skipped some things about preferences, so you would not be responsible for questions asking about them. In this old exam, that means questions 5 and 9. Though, you should still be able to deduce the answers from your existing knowledge!\nQuestions draw from topics in Unit 1 and just because topics or questions were not in the practice exam does NOT mean they may not show up on your exam.**1 Aside from minor extensions, no mathematical problem on any exam should be something you have not seen in some form before.\nLook at the practice exam before our Review day. I will post the answer key during the weekend. I am happy to discuss other individual answers and strategies during Office Hours.\n My Advice Make sure you do all of the homework problems and learn from the answer keys to the homeworks, as well as the in-class practice problems. All of the math problems are largely in the same style as the in-class \u0026amp; homework questions. While some of the questions should be novel applications, conceptual questions on homeworks will get you in the right headspace to think about answering a question on an exam.2\nThe number one cause of problems for students is overthinking the question. I am almost never trying to trick you! I am usually looking for a straightforward answer that can be explained in a simple sentence.\nI also suggest not trying to memorize relationships (i.e. whether cross-price elasticity of demand is positive or negative for complements; price and revenue move together when demand is inelastic, etc.)! You have an equal chance of remembering it correctly or incorrectly. I would rather recommend you use your intuition and think through a real life example that makes sense, which will then match the math.\nThings you should probably memorize  the optimum consumption bundle is when the slopes (of indifference curve and budget constraint) are equal; marginal benefit = marginal cost; consumer’s \u0026amp; market’s exchange rate are equal (they all say the same thing, choose whatever resonates with you) \\[\\frac{MU_x}{MU_y}=\\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\] elasticity means “responsiveness” between variables what marginal rate of substitution, slopes of indifference curves \u0026amp; budget constraints, marginal utility, and various elasticities mean, in English     I hope that this is obvious. I write this to ensure there is no misunderstanding.↩︎\n The point of exams is to apply what you’ve learned, not to literally regurgitate it!

M. Forster\n How to Write a Good Paper  How to Write a Good Paper (Slides)](/slides/paper-slides.html)--  \n Download as PDF\nSee examples of good Op-eds from previous students on Blackboard (Under Course Documents)\n Overview Your task is to write an Opinion-Editorial (Op-ed) piece that applies the economic way of thinking to some public policy-relevant issue. An op-ed is a newspaper article that expresses the opinions of a writer who is unaffiliated with the newspaper or its editorial board. Often, the writer of an op-ed has no journalism experience, or (as you will soon discover), little understanding of economics. Thus, you are at no disadvantage as a student just beginning your experience with economics and writing! To get an idea, look at any newspaper’s “Opinion” section on their website or in print.\nThe purpose of this assignment is fourfold: (1) to demonstrate to you that economics is a wonderful way of thinking about any social issue, (2) for you to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (3) to develop your writing and argumentative skills, and (4) to help you develop, change, and/or strengthen your own views by grappling with them in writing.\nIn general, am looking for a short paper that puts forth an argument and defends it. You should be able to summarize your position in one sentence – the thesis of your paper that you will argue for. It should be a reasonably original argument (it is difficult with limited knowledge to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. It should use some principle(s) or insight(s) from (micro) economics to bolster your conclusions.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. Both to disincentivize procrastination, and because I have no time to read 100 papers right before the end of class, I will stop reading and commenting on drafts after April 30\nIf you publish your op-ed in any media outlet (newspapers, news websites, major blogs) by the end of the semester, you will earn extra credit according to the following scale:1\n  Publication Examples Points    Hood-affiliated outlet The Blue and Grey, Professors’ blogs 10  Local/regional Newspaper Frederick News-Post 20  National Newspaper/blog NY Times, WaPo, WSJ, USA Today, HuffPo 40    Meeting the market test is what matters most!\nYour Op-Ed, with a word count, is due by 11:59 PM Monday May 9, via Chalk-and-Wire upload, and constitutes 20% of your final course grade.\n Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics The goal of any op-ed is to convince reasonably-educated readers of some particular conclusion (also known as a thesis). This conclusion is of course, the opinion of the author, but this opinion must be backed by theory and evidence that leads reasonable people to agree with that conclusion. The claim you make as your conclusion should be relevant, debatable, testable, and provide new insight on a topic. Telling the reader “people who do not recycle are selfish” is neither informative nor persuasive, but telling the reader “recycling reduces the amount of trash going into local landfills by X tons a year” is at least informative, if not also persuasive. You are free to take any position on any issue that you choose, so long as it is backed by evidence and sound use of the economic way of thinking. For more details, see my presentation slides linked above.\nI always hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers A and B say the same thing, but paper B says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper B is a better paper. In any event, this assignment will largely follow the style of most major newspapers. Your op-ed must be between 500 and 1000 words. You must include a word count with your final copy. There are no other formal requirements but, I recommend formatting it in 12 point Times New Roman or Arial font, double spaced, just to make it easier for me to read (and nearly every other paper you write will ask for this).\nWhile this is not a research paper, I do want you to include some scholarly sources – for example, if you cite the work of an economist on the issue, or if you use statistics, data, or facts (which you should!). While newspapers do not publish a bibliography for each op-ed, they will scrutinize every empirical claim and ask the author for sources to back it up. Thus, I would like a list of sources you used for your article, and expect you to have at least 1-3, depending on your topic and argument. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format this list, just please be consistent. Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested style.\n Suggested Topics Remember that economics is a way of analyzing the world, rather than a narrow domain of topics for studying. Thus, while you may certainly write about the typical “mundane” topics of economics we often think about (money, monopoly, inflation, etc), I strongly encourage you to apply economics to something you find much more interesting about the world - from corruption in FIFA, to the constitutional political economy of pirates, to bitcoin displacing currencies, to the illegal downloading of Game of Thrones, to the cultural institutions of the Jersey Shore, to the monopoly power of the WWE in wrestling, to the relationship of Uber \u0026amp; Airbnb to taxis and hotels, to the privatization of asteroids, to the economics of crowdfunding, to drugs, sex, and rock n roll. In fact, it is often those topics that are most eccentric and “out in left field” that make the best op-eds!\nThere are plenty of issues around us, both immediate and visible (racism and policing, college costs, ISIS, planned parenthood, gun control, etc) and latent long term issues (monetary policy and interest rates, the drug war, government spending and debt, science funding, etc).\nThe scope of topics allowed for your paper is anything that uses the economic way of thinking to make some sort of conclusion. This is an extremely wide scope, but here are a few main types of op-eds that will tend to result from this, along with some great examples of op-eds that use economics to reach an interesting or provocative conclusion.\nTaking a stand on a position, either actively being discussed in the news, or a long-standing underlying issue   The Case for Getting Rid of Borders - Completely (The Atlantic) The Racial Reality of Policing (Wall Street Journal) Zoning Out the Poor (Washington Post) This Child Doesn’t Need a Solar Panel (Wall Street Journal) How to Save Detroit (Wall Street Journal) In an Uber World, Fortune Favors the Freelancer (New York Times) What the West Gets Wrong About Russia (New York Times)  Criticizing recent statements, current popular fallacies, or policy proposals of others in the news   Shut Up Royal Baby Haters, Monarchy is Awesome (Washington Post) Trump’s Protectionist Fallacies Have Been Refuted By Free Market Economists for Hundreds of Years (Huffington Post) Trump’s Exploits Rational Ignorance (USA Today) Bernie Sanders on Immigrants: Silly, Tribal and Economically Illiterate (Newsweek) The Myth of a Stagnant Middle Class (Wall Street Journal) The ‘77 cents on the Dollar’ Myth About Women’s Pay (Wall Street Journal) How Everyone Gets the Sharing Economy Wrong (Wall Street Journal) Why Bill Gates Hates my Book (Wall Street Journal) In Zimbabwe, We Don’t Cry for Lions (New York Times)  Providing new insight into a social phenomenon that is interesting or novel, designed to get people talking   Driven to Kill: Why Drivers in China Intentionally Kill the Pedestrians they Hit (Slate) The Case for the City-State (Wall Street Journal) What Hollywood Can Teach Us About the Future of Work (New York Times) Losing is Good for You (New York Times) The $250 Econ 101 Textbook (Wall Street Journal) Cash for Kidneys: The Case for a Market for Organs (Wall Street Journal) The Bitcoin Schism Shows the Genius of Open Source (Wired) Should Physician Pay Be Tied to Performance? (Wall Street Journal)   Sources for Inspiration Here is a list of a few places you might consider to dig up some information on your topic, or to help you find a topic. Just be sure to read and cite the actual sources that these secondary sources cite.\n Major news outlets (e.g. CNN, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post, the Guardian) and wherever you may find your news (e.g. reddit, Buzzfeed, etc) both for current events, and also their Opinion/Commentary sections for other op-eds to learn from and/or critique Wikipedia – no seriously, it is the first place I go to learn about a new topic. Just be sure to actually investigate the underlying research and use that for your references! Economics Podcasts  Econtalk – a fantastic podcast series by Russ Roberts that interviews famous economists, philosophers, businesspeople, and other figures who have an impact on the world of ideas Freakonomics (Radio) – another great podcast by one of the authors of the famed Freakonomics books about intermediate-level economic topics, often an in-depth series of interviews on a major issue NPR Planet Money – another good podcast series on economics topics and current events, much shorter and more 10,000-foot level approach than Econtalk or Freakonomics  Popular Economists’ Blogs/Blogs on Economics:  Marginal Revolution – Tyler Cowen \u0026amp; Alex Tabarrok (head and shoulders above the rest!) Cafe Hayek – Don Boudreaux (libertarian-leaning, mostly just Don on trade and micro-policy) EconLog – Bryan Caplan, David Henderson (libertarian-leaning, good analysis) The Conscience of a Liberal – Paul Krugman at New York Times (strong left-wing politics) The Grumpy Economist – John Cochrane (Chicago School approach) Greg Mankiw’s Blog – Greg Mankiw (moderate conservative, New Keynesian approach) Undercover Economist – Tim Harford (British, non-political, very easy to understand) Chris Blattman – Chris Blattman (great on economic development, poverty, and conflict in poor countries) Slate Star Codex – “Scott Alexander” (a pseudonym, apparently a Medical Student, but one of the most lucid social science blogs ever written) Fivethirtyeight – Nate Silver \u0026amp; co. (a journalist, but a leader on using data and statistics in social science and journalism) Andrew Gelman – Andrew Gelman (a statistician, but another leader on using data and statistics for social science)    Grading Rubric and Deadlines Here is the rubric that I will use to grade your paper:\n  Category Points    Persuasiveness 30  Soundness 30  Clarity 20  Organization 10  References 5  Style 5  TOTAL 100     Persuasiveness: How persuasive is your argument? Would a reasonably educated college-level reader who is familiar with economics and statistics but not necessarily this course find themselves understanding your argument and agreeing with you? [Write for an audience wider than just members of this class. Therefore, don’t use terms, sources, or “inside jokes” that only other students in this class (and no one else) would understand.] Remember, your goal is not to convince me (though you may), your goal is to convince any educated reader, and I grade you the probability that this is likely. You are the lawyer, I am the judge, and your audience is the jury. Soundness: Are your theories consistent and logical, and did you apply them correctly? Did you choose relevant (and non-cherry picked) evidence to back it up? Are your facts, data, or case studies accurate? Clarity How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your research question is, how you answer it, and what your results are? Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples? Organization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding? References: Does your paper use multiple reputable references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section? Style: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice? This is somewhat subjective, and hence, the smallest portion of your grade.    Note: Websites like reddit, Buzzfeed, or personal blogs that do not require professional editorial approval do not count!↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647366275,"objectID":"9db233650904a46b218093217b62aa89","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/assignments/op-ed/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignments/op-ed/","section":"assignments","summary":"How to Write a Good Paper Overview Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics Suggested Topics Sources for Inspiration Grading Rubric and Deadlines    Due by the end of the day Monday May 9 by CHALK-AND-WIRE UPLOAD (include a word count)    “How can I know what I think until I see what I say?” — E.

Hayek (1974 Economics Nobel Laureate)\n Microeconomic Analysis is a collection of analytical tools for modeling and understanding how decisions made by agents (individuals and firms) in a context of market institutions lead to social coordination and the creation of value. This toolkit is the analytical foundation for exploring all fields and applications of economics as a social science, has many practical applications in business, finance, politics, and insights into any realm of human endeavors. Economics, after all, is the study of human action. At the intermediate level, these concepts are made more rigorous through the use of mathematical models, but we will first and foremost lay the theoretical foundations with economic intuition. As such, this class assumes you have met the required prerequisite courses by taking principles of microeconomics (ECON 206).\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning.\nCourse Format (and Covid) As of Fall 2021, all students are expected to be on campus except those with special approved exemptions. As such, this course will be taught in-person and synchronously until or unless otherwise announced.\nYou are expected to come to class except due to medical reasons or other legitimate conflicts. Watching videos are not a substitute for attending class.1 Please see the attendance policy for more.\nIn any event that we are unable to meet in person, I will hold class meetings at the same day/time live on Zoom, and post all recorded lectures via Panopto on Blackboard, and all assignments will be submitted online (often via Blackboard).\nLearning During a Global Pandemic While we have made some progress in returning to normal, this remains a unique semester and a lot of things are still awful right now. None of us signed up for this. None of us are really okay, we’re all just pretending for everyone else.\nMany of you may be dealing with hardships at home and at work, and are generally juggling many more problems than usual. Everyone’s future plans have been completely put on hold or cancelled to a large degree.\nI am prioritizing us supporting each other as human beings during this crazy era, and will try to use simple, accessible solutions that make sense for the most people, and above all, to be flexible.\nIf you tell me you’re having trouble, I will do whatever I can to help, and not judge you or think less of you. I hope you will extend me the same courtesy.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are however always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through. If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nI want you to learn a lot from this course, but it is more important for you to remain healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning.\n  Course objectives By the end of this course, you will:\napply the models of microeconomics (constrained optimization and equilibrium) towards explaining real world behavior of individuals, firms, and governments explore the effects of economic and political processes on market performance (competition, market prices, profits and losses, property rights, entrepreneurship, market power, market failures, public policy, government failures) apply the economic way of thinking to real world issues in writing  Given these objectives, this course fulfills all three of the learning outcomes for the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business Economics B.A. program:\n Use quantitative tools and techniques in the preparation, interpretation, analysis and presentation of data and information for problem solving and decision making […] Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy […] Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[…]  Fair warning: Economics is hard. This, in particular, may be of the hardest courses that you will take, primarily due to the mathematical content. Using the economic way of thinking is a skill, it is literally retraining your brain to interpret and analyze the world in a novel way, and is not something that can be memorized. I will do my best to make this class intuitive and helpful, if not interesting. If at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in higher regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR) and the Beneficial-Hodson Library.\nFree tutoring in many subjects is available for Hood students through Thinking Storm professional tutoring and Hood peer tutoring. Hood peer tutoring is located in the Tutoring Center adjacent to the Student Success Center in the Beneficial Hodson Library and Learning Commons. Appointments and online tutoring can be accessed through Blackboard and located under tools/academic tutoring. Tutoring is available evenings and weekends as well as during the day to help meet your needs. For more information about tutoring and to see the specific subject tutoring offered, please visit the student success website here or contact the student success center at studentsuccess@hood.edu.\nSee my tips for success in this course.\n Required Course materials You can find all course materials at my dedicated website for this course: microF21.classes.ryansafner.com. Links to the website are posted on our Blackboard course page. Please familiarize yourself with the website, see that it contains this syllabus, resources to help you, and our schedule. On the schedule page, you can find each module with its own class page (start there!) along with all related readings, lecture slides, practice problems, and assignments.\nMy lecture slides will be shared with you, and serve as your primary resource, but our main “textbook” below is recommended as the next best resource and will be available from the campus bookstore. I will discuss more about textbooks and materials in the first module.\nBooks Goolsbee, Austan, Steven Levitt, and Chad Syverson, 2012, Microeconomics 2nd ed, USA: Worth Publishers, ISBN: 978-1464187025  You are welcome to purchase the book by other means (e.g. Amazon, half.com, etc). I have no financial stake in requiring you to purchase this book. You are welcome to use previous version of the book, but carefully verify the reading assignments, as the material may be different across versions.\n  Assignments and Grades Your final course grade is the weighted average of the following assignments. You can find general descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page and more specific information and examples on each assignment’s page on the schedule page.\n   Frequency  Assignment  Weight      1  Opinion-Editorial  20%    5  Homeworks  20% (using average HW grade)    3  Exams  20% (each)     Each assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Letter-grade equivalents are based on the following scale:\n  Grade  Range  Grade  Range      A  93–100%  C  73–76%    A−  90–92%  C−  70–72%    B+  87–89%  D+  67–69%    B  83–86%  D  63–66%    B−  80–82%  D−  60–62%    C+  77–79%  F  \u0026lt; 60%     See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\nThese grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards \\((\\geq\\) 0.5) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of giving out grades, I merely report the grade that you earn. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time).\nSave As - PDF, or File - Export - PDF.] to **upload on Blackboard** under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph \u0026 convert them **to a single PDF**, if they are easily readable, but this is *not preferred*. See my [guide to making a PDF](https://gameF21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments) - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the `pdf` above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers). For the few questions that ask you to draw a **graph**, *try* to do so *on your computer* (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately. ## Exams There will be three exams (one at the end of each unit) including the final exam. Each exam only covers the material in its associated unit (i.e. no exam is cumulative). These exams provide feedback both to you and to me that ensures everyone is progressing on schedule and apprehending the material. This is critical, as the rest of the course, and indeed, any future economics course you take, will build off of this foundation. Exams will be released **on Blackboard** as a timed assignment. You will have 2 hours once you open the exam on Blackboard. You will not need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accommodate the difficulties of taking an exam at home. Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but the timer will continue to run once the exam is first opened. ## Opinion-Editorial Economic fallacies have always been popular, and journalists, politicians, and talking heads consistently engage in faulty economic reasoning in print and on television. Your task, as a student of economics, is to find some issue discussed in the past year, and write a critique of media discussion of that issue. Alternatively, instead of critiquing the reasoning or statements of others, you may write an advocacy piece, where you propose some economic policy and argue to persuade readers to endorse it. You will be graded both on the soundness of your economic reasoning and the quality of your writing. I would be happy to co-author an Op-Ed with anyone who writes an exemplary Op-Ed. Students who successfully publish their work in a media outlet will earn *extra credit* on their Op-Ed grade. I will provide ample resources and examples to help you accomplish this, you can find more on the associated [assignment page](assignment/op-ed).-- No extra credit is available\n Policies and Expectations This syllabus is a contract between you, the student, and me, your instructor. It has been carefully and deliberately thought out. (A syllabus can and will be used as a legal document for disputes tried at a court of law. Ask me how I know.), and I will uphold my end of the agreement and expect you to uphold yours.\nIn the language of game theory, this syllabus is my commitment device. I am a very understanding person, and I know that exceptions to rules often need to be made for students. However, to be fair to all students the syllabus artificially constrains my ability to make exceptions at a whim for anyone. This prevents clever students from exploiting my congenial personality at everyone else’s expense. Please read and familiarize yourself with the course policies and expectations of you. Chances are, if you have a question, it is answered herein.\nAttendence Your day-to-day classroom attendance is not graded. My philosophy is that you are all adults and must take ownership of your own learning or else you will not succeed. Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nHowever, as required under Hood College’s “Promise of Fall Plan,” (Ch. 2-C) your classroom attendance will be recorded at every class meeting. This is primarily to facilitate contact tracing.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy.\n Late Assignments I will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 20 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nOp-eds: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your Op-ed is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.\n Grading I will try my best to post grades on Blackboard’s Grading Center and return graded assignments to you within about one week of you turning them in. There will be exceptions. Where applicable, I will post answer keys once I know most homeworks are turned in (see Late Assignments above for penalties). Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades. See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\n Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Students must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nIn addition to in-person office hours, you can also make an appointment for “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:\n  Netiquette When using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (“Netiquette”). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X?’” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”).\n Privacy Maryland law requires all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded. If you join in, and certainly if you participate, you are consenting to be recorded. However, as described below, videos are not accessible beyond our class.\nLive lectures are recorded on Zoom and posted to Blackboard via Panopto, a secure course management system for video. Among other nice features (such as multiple video screens, close captioning, and time-stamped search functions!), Panopto is authenticated via your Blackboard credentials, ensuring that our course videos are not accessible to the open internet.\nFor the privacy of your peers, and to foster an environment of trust and academic freedom to explore ideas, do not record our course lectures or discussions. You are already getting my official copies.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents me from disclosing or discussing any student information, including grades and records about student performance. If the student is at least 18 years of age, parents (or spouses) do not have a right to obtain this information, except with consent by the student.\nMany of you may be tuning in remotely, living with parents, and may have occasional interruptions due to sharing a space. This is normal and fine, but know that I will protect your privacy and not discuss your performance when parents (or anyone other than you, for that matter) are present, without your explicit consent.\n Enrollment Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class with no penalty is Thursday, February 3. Be aware of important dates.\n Honor Code Hood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n Van Halen and M\u0026amp;Ms When you have completed reading the syllabus, email me a picture of the band Van Halen and a picture of a bowl of M\u0026amp;Ms. If you do this before the date of the first exam, you will get bonus points on the exam. If 75-100% of the class does this, you each get 2 points. If 50-75% of the class does this, you each get 4 points. If 25-50% of the class does this, you each get 6 points. If 0-25% of the class does this, you each get 8 points. Yes, you read this correctly.\n Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations College courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.\n ACBSP Information Hood College is an accredited member of the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), an organization devoted to enhancing business education. In receiving and maintaining this accreditation, the faculty has made a commitment to the continuous improvement, innovation, and scholarship of the Department of Economics and Management. For you, this means that your educational experience undergoes ongoing validation to ensure it meets the most rigorous international standards of business education. Only a select group of institutions have received this status and it is an attribute of Hood for which you should take great pride.\nPragmatically, our accreditation means that we will engage in the ongoing use of measures, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, to assess the performance of our students and the program. We ask that you take very seriously the surveys and other measurement devices we will use – your best work and honest response will help us best assess and improve our program.\n  Tentative Schedule You can find a full schedule with much more details, including the readings, appendices, and other further resources for each class meeting on the schedule page.\n  On average, even for students who complete all assignments, those that do not regularly attend class suffer by a full letter grade, (Levitt 1993).↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644616569,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"https://microS22.classes.ryansafner.com/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Format (and Covid)  Learning During a Global Pandemic  Course objectives Required Course materials  Books  Assignments and Grades Policies and Expectations  Attendence Late Assignments Grading Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Netiquette Privacy Enrollment Honor Code Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations ACBSP Information  Tentative Schedule   Instructor  Dr. Ryan Safner  Office: Rosenstock 110  Office Hours: MW 1:30-2:30 \u0026amp; by appt  safner@hood.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
